Analysis of TG-3390's operations, targeting, and tools led CTU researchers to assess with moderate conﬁdence the group is located in the People's Republic of China. The threat actors target a wide range of organizations: CTU researchers have observed TG-3390 actors obtaining conﬁdential data on defense manufacturing projects, but also targeting other industry verticals and attacking organizations involved in international relations. The group extensively uses long-running strategic web compromises  (SWCs), and relies on whitelists to deliver payloads to select victims. In comparison to other threat groups, TG-3390 is notable for its tendency to compromise Microsoft Exchange servers using a custom backdoor and credential logger.[1] [2] CTU researchers divided the  about TG-3390 into two sections: strategic and tactical.  includes an assessment of the ongoing threat posed by the threat group.

Computer network defenders can use this information to reduce the time and effort associated with responding to TG-3390.threat intelligence Strategic threat intelligence Tactical threat intelligence Key points Explanations of how CTU researchers identify attribution and gauge conﬁdence levels are available in the . Appendix A CTU researchers assess with moderate conﬁdence that TG-3390 is based in the People's Republic of China. CTU researchers have evidence that the threat group compromised U.S. and UK organizations in the following verticals: manufacturing (speciﬁcally aerospace (including defense contractors), automotive, technology, energy, and pharmaceuticals), education, and legal, as well as organizations focused on international relations. Based on analysis of the group's SWCs, TG-3390 operations likely affect organizations in other countries and verticals. TG-3390 operates a broad and long-running campaign of SWCs and has compromised approximately 100 websites as of this publication. Through an IP address whitelisting process, the threat group selectively targets visitors to these websites. After the initial compromise, TG-3390 delivers the HttpBrowser backdoor to its victims. The threat actors then move quickly to compromise Microsoft Exchange servers and to gain complete control of the target environment. The threat actors are adept at identifying key data stores and selectively exﬁltrating all of the high- value information associated with their goal. CTU researchers recommend the following practices to prevent or detect TG-3390 intrusions: Search web log ﬁles for evidence of web server scanning using the URIs listed in the  section and evidence of exﬁltration using the User-Agent in the  section.Exploitation Actions on objective Require two-factor authentication for all remote access solutions, including OWA. Audit ISAPI ﬁlters and search for web shells on Microsoft Exchange servers. Strategic threat intelligence CTU researchers assess the threat posed by a threat group by reviewing intent and capability (see Figure 1). Threat groups pose varying threats to different organizations, and even a very capable group may pose a low threat if it does not have the intent to target a particular organization. Figure 1. Threat is based on a threat group's intent and capability. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) Intent CTU researchers infer intent by aggregating observations, analyzing a threat group's activity, and placing the information in a wider context. Like many threat groups, TG-3390 conducts strategic web compromises (SWCs), also known as watering hole attacks, on websites associated with the target organization's vertical or demographic to increase the likelihood of ﬁnding victims with relevant information. CTU researchers assess with high conﬁdence that TG- 3390 uses information gathered from prior reconnaissance activities to selectively compromise users who visit websites under its control. Most websites compromised by TG-3390 actors are afﬁliated with ﬁve types of organizations around the world: large manufacturing companies, particularly those supplying defense organizations energy companies embassies in Washington, DC representing countries in the Middle East, Europe, and Asia, likely to target U.S.-based users involved in international relations non-governmental organizations (NGOs), particularly those focused on international relations and defense government organizations Based on this information, CTU researchers assess that TG-3390 aims to collect defense technology and capability intelligence, other industrial intelligence, and political intelligence from governments and NGOs. Attribution To assess attribution, CTU researchers analyze observed activity, third-party reporting, and contextual intelligence. For the following reasons, CTU researchers assess with moderate conﬁdence that TG-3390 has a Chinese nexus: The SWC of a Uyghur cultural website suggests intent to target the Uyghur ethnic group, a Muslim minority group primarily found in the Xinjiang region of China. Threat groups outside of China are unlikely to target the Uyghur people. TG-3390 uses the PlugX remote access tool. The menus for PlugX's server-side component are written exclusively in Standard Chinese (Mandarin), suggesting that PlugX operators are familiar with this language. CTU researchers have observed TG-3390 activity between 04:00 and 09:00 UTC, which is 12:00 to 17:00 local time in China (UTC +8). The timeframe maps to the second half of the workday in China. The threat actors have used the Baidu search engine, which is only available in Chinese, to conduct reconnaissance activities. CTU researchers have observed the threat group obtaining information about speciﬁc U.S. defense projects that would be desirable to those operating within a country with a manufacturing base, an interest in U.S. military capability, or both. CTU researchers recognize that the evidence supporting this attribution is circumstantial. It is possible that TG-3390 is false-ﬂag operation by a threat group outside of China that is deliberately planting indications of a Chinese origin. Capability To assess a threat group's capability, CTU researchers analyze its resources, technical proﬁciency, and tradecraft. Resources TG-3390 has access to proprietary tools, some of which are used exclusively by TG-3390 and others that are shared among a few Chinese threat groups. The complexity and continual development of these tools indicates a mature development process. TG-3390 can quickly leverage compromised network infrastructure during an operation and can conduct simultaneous intrusions into multiple environments. This ability is further demonstrated by analysis of interactions between TG-3390 operators and a target environment. CTU researchers found no evidence of multiple operators working simultaneously against a single organization. This efﬁciency of operation (a 1:1 ratio of operator to observed activity) suggests that TG-3390 can scale to conduct the maximum number of simultaneous operations. These characteristics suggest that the threat group is well resourced and has access to a tools development team and a team focused on SWCs. Technical proﬁciency TG-3390's obfuscation techniques in SWCs complicate detection of malicious web trafﬁc redirects. Malware used by the threat group can be conﬁgured to bypass network-based detection; however, the threat actors rarely modify host-based conﬁguration settings when deploying payloads. CTU researchers have observed the threat actors installing a credential logger and backdoor on Microsoft Exchange servers, which requires a technical grasp of  (IIS). TG-3390 uses older exploits to compromise targets, and CTU researchers have not observed the threat actors using zero-day exploits as of this publication. The threat actors demonstrated the ability to adapt when reentering a network after an eviction, overcoming technical barriers constructed by network defenders.Internet Information Services Tradecraft In addition to using SWCs to target speciﬁc types of organizations, TG-3390 uses spearphishing emails to target speciﬁc victims. CTU researchers assess with high conﬁdence that the threat actors follow an established playbook during an intrusion. They quickly move away from their initial access vector to hide their entry point and then target Exchange servers as a new access vector. As of this publication, CTU researchers have not discovered how TG-3390 keeps track of the details associated with its compromised assets and credentials. However, the threat actors' ability to reuse these assets and credentials, sometimes weeks or months after the initial compromise, indicates the group is disciplined and well organized. After gaining access to a target network in one intrusion analyzed by CTU researchers, TG-3390 actors identiﬁed and exﬁltrated data for speciﬁc projects run by the target organization, indicating that they successfully obtained the information they sought. Data exﬁltration occurred almost four weeks after the initial compromise and continued for two weeks (see Figure 2). Figure 2. Data exﬁltration timeline. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) Note: The adversary's end goal is to exﬁltrate, not inﬁltrate. Organizations often miss multiple opportunities to detect and disrupt the threat actors before they can achieve their objective. Alerts for credential theft tools and privileged account lockouts should be investigated. Tactical threat intelligence Known tools CTU researchers have observed TG-3390 actors using tools that are favored by multiple threat groups: PlugX — A remote access tool notable for communications that may contain HTTP headers starting with \"X-\" (e.g., \"X-Session: 0\"). Its presence on a compromised system allows a threat actor to execute a wide variety of commands, including uploading and downloading ﬁles, and spawning a reverse shell. The malware can be conﬁgured to use multiple network protocols to avoid network-based detection. DLL side loading is often used to maintain persistence on the compromised system. HttpBrowser (also known as TokenControl) — A backdoor notable for HTTPS communications with the HttpBrowser/1.0 User-Agent (see Figure 3). HttpBrowser's executable code may be obfuscated through structured exception handling and return-oriented programming. Its presence on a compromised system allows a threat actor to spawn a reverse shell, upload or download ﬁles, and capture keystrokes. Antivirus detection for HttpBrowser is extremely low and is typically based upon heuristic signatures. DLL side loading has been used to maintain persistence on the compromised system. More information about HttpBrowser is available in . Appendix B   Figure 3. HttpBrowser URI. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) ChinaChopper web shell — A web-based executable script (see Figure 4) that allows a threat actor to execute commands on the compromised system. The server-side component provides a simple graphical user interface for threat actors interacting with web shells. Figure 4. ChinaChopper web shell. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) Passwords, like \"admin-na-google123!@#\" shown in Figure 4, are required to interact with the web shell. TG-3390 has used additional web shells containing similarly formatted passwords. Hunter — A web application scanning tool written by @tojen to identify vulnerabilities in Apache Tomcat, Red Hat JBoss Middleware, and Adobe ColdFusion (see Figure 5). It can also identify open ports, collect web banners, and download secondary ﬁles. Figure 5. Hunter usage. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) The following tools appear to be exclusive to TG-3390: OwaAuth web shell — A web shell and credential stealer deployed to Microsoft Exchange servers. It is installed as an ISAPI ﬁlter. Captured credentials are DES-encrypted using the password \"12345678\" and are written to the log.txt ﬁle in the root directory. Like the ChinaChopper web shell, the OwaAuth web shell requires a password. However, the OwaAuth web shell password contains the victim organization's name. More information about the OwaAuth web shell is available in . Appendix C ASPXTool — A modiﬁed version of the ASPXSpy web shell (see Figure 6). It is deployed to internally accessible servers running Internet Information Services (IIS). Figure 6. ASPXTool web shell. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) TG-3390 actors have also used the following publicly available tools: Windows Credential Editor (WCE) — obtains passwords from memory gsecdump — obtains passwords from memory winrar — compresses data for exﬁltration nbtscan — scans NetBIOS name servers Tactics, techniques, and procedures Incident response engagements have given CTU researchers insight into the tactics TG-3390 employs during intrusions. Reconnaissance CTU researchers have not observed TG-3390 actors performing reconnaissance prior to compromising organizations. As discussed in the  section, the threat actors appear to wait until they have established a foothold.Actions on objectives Development TG-3390 actors use command and control (C2) domains for extended periods of time but frequently change the domains' IP addresses. The new IP addresses are typically on the same subnet as the previous ones. TG-3390 is capable of using a C2 infrastructure that spans multiple networks and registrars. The most common registrar used by the adversary is HiChina Zhicheng Technology Ltd. The threat actors have a demonstrated ability to move from one network provider to another, using some infrastructure for extended periods of time and other domains for only a few days. Seemingly random activity patterns in infrastructure deployment and usage, along with the ability to use a wide variety of geographically diverse infrastructure, help the threat actors avoid detection. TG-3390 SWCs may be largely geographically independent, but the group's most frequently used C2 registrars and IP net blocks are located in the U.S. Using a U.S.-based C2 infrastructure (see Figure 7) to compromise targets in the U.S. helps TG-3390 actors avoid geo-blocking and geo-ﬂagging measures used in network defense. Figure 7. Geolocation of TG-3390 infrastructure observed by CTU researchers. The dark green signiﬁes a high count of C2 registrars and IP net blocks, while the light green represents a smaller count. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) The threat actors create PlugX DLL stub loaders that will run only after a speciﬁc date. The compile dates of the samples analyzed by CTU researchers are all later than the hard-coded August 8, 2013 date, indicating that the code might be reused from previous tools. The OwaAuth web shell is likely created with a builder, given that the PE compile time of the binary does not change between instances and the conﬁguration ﬁelds are padded to a speciﬁc size. The adversaries modify publicly available tools such as ASPXSpy to remove identifying characteristics that network defenders use to identify web shells. Weaponization As of this publication, CTU researchers are unsure if TG-3390 relies on weaponizers to package tools and exploits. Delivery TG-3390 conducts SWCs or sends spearphishing emails with ZIP archive attachments. The ZIP archives have names relevant to the targets and contain both legitimate ﬁles and malware. One archive sample analyzed by CTU researchers contained a legitimate PDF ﬁle, a benign image of interest to targets (see Figure 8), and an HttpBrowser installer disguised as an image ﬁle. Figure 8. Decoy image. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) In SWCs analyzed by CTU researchers, the threat actors added the Dean Edwards  JavaScript code shown in Figure 9 to the end of a legitimate website's menu page.packed Figure 9. SWC code. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) As shown in Figure 10, the  JavaScript code reveals an iframe pointing to an IP address that is hosting the exploit.unpacked Figure 10. Unpacked JavaScript code. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) Both the redirect code on the compromised site and the exploit code appear and disappear, indicating that the adversaries add the code when they want to leverage the SWC and remove the code when it is not in use to limit the visibility of their operations. The threat actors have evolved to whitelisting IP addresses and only delivering the exploit and payload to speciﬁc targets of interest. CTU researchers have observed TG- 3390 compromising a target organization's externally and internally accessible assets, such as an OWA server, and adding redirect code to point internal users to an external website that hosts an exploit and delivers malware. Exploitation TG-3390 actors have used Java exploits in their SWCs. In particular, the threat actors have exploited  , a vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment, to deliver the HttpBrowser backdoor; and  , a vulnerability in JBoss, to compromise internally and externally accessible assets used to redirect users' web browsers to exploit code.CVE- 2011-3544 CVE- 2010-0738 In activity analyzed by CTU researchers, TG-3390 executed the Hunter web application scanning tool against a target server running IIS. Hunter queried the following URIs in a speciﬁc order to determine if the associated software conﬁgurations are insecure, and all queries contained the HttpClient User-Agent: GET /manager/html/ — Tomcat web application manager GET /jmx-console/ — JBoss conﬁguration GET /CFIDE/administrator/login.cfm — ColdFusion conﬁguration Installation TG-3390 uses DLL side loading, a technique that involves running a legitimate, typically digitally signed, program that loads a malicious DLL. CTU researchers have observed the threat actors employing legitimate Kaspersky antivirus variants in analyzed samples. The DLL acts as a stub loader, which loads and executes the shell code. The adversaries have used this technique to allow PlugX and HttpBrowser to persist on a system. Note: DLL side loading is a prevalent persistence technique that is used to launch a multitude of backdoors. The challenge is detecting known good software loading and running malware. As security controls have improved, DLL side loading has evolved to load a payload stored in a different directory or from a registry value. In other cases, threat actors placed web shells on externally accessible servers, sometimes behind a reverse proxy, to execute commands on the compromised system. TG-3390 actors have deployed the OwaAuth web shell to Exchange servers, disguising it as an ISAPI ﬁlter. The IIS w3wp.exe process loads the malicious DLL, which CTU researchers have observed in the Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\ClientAccess\\Owa\\Bin directory. Command and control To traverse the ﬁrewall, C2 trafﬁc for most TG-3390 tools occurs over ports 53, 80, and 443. The PlugX malware can be conﬁgured to use HTTP, DNS, raw TCP, or UDP to avoid network-based detection. In one sample analyzed by CTU researchers, PlugX was conﬁgured with hard-coded user credentials to bypass a proxy that required authentication. Newer HttpBrowser versions use SSL with self-signed certiﬁcates to encrypt network communications. TG-3390 actors frequently change the C2 domain's A record to point to the loopback IP address 127.0.0.1, which is a variation of a technique known as \"parking.\" Other variations of parking point the IP address to Google's recursive name server 8.8.8.8, an address belonging to Conﬂuence, or to other non-routable addresses. When the adversaries' operations are live, they modify the record again to point the C2 domain to an IP address they can access. A domain name parking example is available in . Appendix D Actions on objective CTU researchers have discovered numerous details about TG-3390 operations, including how the adversaries explore a network, move laterally, and exﬁltrate data. As shown in Figure 11, after compromising an initial victim's system (patient 0), the threat actors use the Baidu search engine to search for the victim's organization name. They then identify the Exchange server and attempt to install the OwaAuth web shell. If the OwaAuth web shell is ineffective because the victim uses two-factor authentication for webmail, the adversaries identify other externally accessible servers and deploy ChinaChopper web shells. Within six hours of entering the environment, the threat actors compromised multiple systems and stole credentials for the entire domain. Figure 11. Timeline, in Eastern Time, of TG-3390's initial entry into a victim's network. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) The threat actors use the Hunter and nbtscan tools, sometimes renamed, to conduct network reconnaissance for vulnerable servers and online systems (see Figure 12). TG-3390 actors favor At.exe to create scheduled tasks for executing commands on remote systems. Figure 12. nbtscan batch script (renamed ipcan.exe) used to proﬁle network. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) Over a few days' span, the threat actors install remote access tools on additional systems based upon the results of the network reconnaissance. They use At.exe to schedule tasks to run self-extracting RAR archives, which install either HttpBrowser or PlugX. CTU researchers observed the threat actors collecting Cisco VPN proﬁles to use when accessing the victim's network via VPN (see Figure 13). Figure 13. Copying of .pcf ﬁles. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) To facilitate lateral movement, the adversaries deploy ASPXTool web shells to internally accessible systems running IIS. CTU researchers have observed the threat actors encrypting data using the password \"admin-windows2014\" and splitting the RAR archives into parts in the recycler directory, with the same name as the uncompressed data (see Figure 14). Figure 14. Batch script used to archive data. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) The number at the end of the password corresponds to the year of the intrusion. For example, the password \"admin-windows2014\" shown in Figure 14 was changed to \"admin-windows2015\" for TG-3390 intrusions conducted in 2015. Note: CTU researchers frequently observe threat actors renaming archiving tools and storing data for exﬁltration in uncommon directories. In some instances, adversaries exceed disk space limits during the exﬁltration process, requiring the staging of archives on multiple systems. Unexplained disk quota alerts on typically underutilized systems warrants immediate investigation. Another batch script run by a scheduled task renames the archives on the ﬁle server (see Figure 15). Figure 15. Batch script used to rename exﬁltrated data. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) CTU researchers have observed TG-3390 actors staging RAR archives, renamed with a .zip ﬁle extension, on externally accessible web servers. The adversaries then issue HTTP GET requests, sometimes with the User- Agent MINIXL, to exﬁltrate the archive parts from the victim's network (see Figure 16). Figure 16. Example GET request from IIS log. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) In other intrusions, data was exﬁltrated using the PlugX remote access tool. Figure 17 shows network data transfer sizes for a month-long period beginning with TG-3390's re-entry into a network. Approximately 300 GB of data was exﬁltrated during that span. Figure 17. Network data transfer sizes to C2 servers after TG-3390 reentry into a network. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) CTU observations Figure 18 is a UTC time wheel depicting which hours the threat actors actively operated in one target environment during a three-day intrusion observed by CTU researchers. The concentric bands represent the days of the week, with Saturday as the outside band and Sunday as the innermost band, and each cell represents an hour. The darker the cell color, the higher the activity level; white indicates no observed activity. TG-3390 was most active between 04:00 and 09:00 UTC. Figure 18. Mapping of TG-3390's interactions with web shells during an intrusion responded to by CTU researchers. The legend across the bottom of the ﬁgure lists the upper bound of interactions that are represented by each color variation on the wheel. Times are based on UTC. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) Response to eviction Successfully evicting TG-3390 from an environment requires a coordinated plan to remove all access points, including remote access tools and web shells. Within weeks of eviction, the threat actors attempt to access their ChinaChopper web shells from previously used IP addresses. Finding the web shells inaccessible, the adversaries search google.co.jp for remote access solutions. CTU researchers discovered the threat actors searching for \"[company] login,\" which directed them to the landing page for remote access. TG-3390 attempts to reenter the environment by identifying accounts that do not require two-factor authentication for remote access solutions, and then brute forcing usernames and passwords. After reestablishing access, the adversaries download tools such as gsecudmp and WCE that are staged temporarily on websites that TG-3390 previously compromised but never used. CTU researchers believe legitimate websites are used to host tools because web proxies categorize the sites as benign. Note: Numerous threat groups use legitimate remote access solutions (VPN, Citrix, OWA, etc.) to enter or reenter a network. After executing an eviction plan, it is paramount to reset all credentials, including those for third-party accounts, preferably after implementing two-factor authentication. TG-3390 actors keep track of and leverage existing ASPXTool web shells in their operations, preferring to issue commands via an internally accessible web shell rather than HttpBrowser or PlugX. After reentering an environment, the threat actors focus on obtaining the active directory contents. Figure 19 shows a timeline of TG-3390 attempting to regain a foothold in a network in a span of only ﬁve hours. Figure 19. Timeline, in Eastern Time, of TG-3390's reentry into a compromised network. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) Note: Relying primarily on network-based security controls will not deter most threat groups from achieving their objective. Adversaries can overcome blacklisted infrastructure in minutes, as TG-3390 actors did when they staged tools on compromised web servers. Team member or team identiﬁer Analysis of the OwaAuth web shell revealed a PDB string with the \"SyberSpace\" username (see Figure 20). Figure 20. OwaAuth web shell PDB string. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) Further research revealed additional tools containing the same username (see Figure 21). Figure 21. PDB strings containing the 'SyberSpace' username. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) CTU researchers have no evidence to determine if these tools are also used by TG-3390. Conclusion TG-3390 is known for compromising organizations via SWCs and moving quickly to install backdoors on Exchange servers. Despite the group's proﬁciency, there are still many opportunities to detect and disrupt its operation by studying its . The threat actors work to overcome existing security controls, or those put in place during an engagement, to complete their mission of exﬁltrating intellectual property. Due to TG-3390's determination, organizations should formulate a solid eviction plan before engaging with the threat actors to prevent them from reentering the network.modus operandi Threat indicators The indicators in Table 1 are associated with TG-3390 activity.

TG-3390 indicators. Appendix A — Identifying attribution and gauging conﬁdence Identifying attribution In most cases, CTU researchers not have intelligence to directly attribute a threat group, so attribution relies on circumstantial evidence and is an assessment rather than a fact. CTU researchers draw on three distinct intelligence bases for evidence of attribution: Observed activity is gathered from CTU researchers' observation and investigation of a threat group's activity on a target network and across Dell SecureWorks data, and analysis of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) the threat group employs. Third-party intelligence is gained from trusted relationships within the security industry and with other private and public sector organizations, as well as analysis of open source intelligence. Contextual analysis compares threat group targets against intelligence requirements of nation states and other threat actors and compares tradecraft employed by a threat group to tradecraft of known threat actors. Gauging conﬁdence level CTU researchers have adopted the grading system  by the U.S. Ofﬁce of the Director of National Intelligence to indicate conﬁdence in their assessments:published  generally indicates that judgments are based on high-quality information, and/or that the nature of the issue makes it possible to render a solid judgment. A \"high conﬁdence\" judgment is not a fact or a certainty, however, and such judgments still carry a risk of being wrong.High conﬁdence  generally means that the information is credibly sourced and plausible but not of sufﬁcient quality or corroborated sufﬁciently to warrant a higher level of conﬁdence.Moderate conﬁdence  generally means that the information's credibility and/or plausibility is questionable, or that the information is too fragmented or poorly corroborated to make solid analytic inferences, or that [there are] signiﬁcant concerns or problems with the sources.Low conﬁdence Appendix B — HttpBrowser analysis HttpBrowser is a remote access tool whose name originates from the hard-coded \"HttpBrowser/1.0\" User- Agent. CTU researchers also identiﬁed a PDB string in the binaries, J:\\TokenControlV3\\ServerDll\\Release\\ServerDll.pdb, which implies that the threat actors may refer to the tool as \"TokenControl.\" Table 2 lists the commands available to threat actors in one of the HttpBrowser variants. Command Functionality Init Create a reverse shell Write Write a ﬁle to the compromised system from the C2 server List List the ﬁles in a directory Upload Upload a ﬁle from the compromised system to the C2 server Table 2. HttpBrowser command set. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) Other variants of the backdoor may include additional commands such as setcmd, settime, uninstall, and down. Table 3 shows the unencrypted URL parameters, along with sample data and a description of the data. URL parameterSample data Description c= Victim->Administrator Hostname and username l= 192.168.1.100 Compromised system's IP address o= 5,1,1,32 Windows major and minor version, coupled with architecture (32 v. 64) u= {B5B70BD7-87FC-499A-B4D1- 98163306F0D8}A GUID r= 1 Boolean value if the malware is running as injected code t= 8035187 Number of milliseconds the computer has been running Table 3. HttpBrowser parameters. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) Appendix C — OwaAuth web shell analysis OwaAuth is a web shell that is installed as an ISAPI ﬁlter on Exchange servers and shares characteristics with the ChinaChopper web shell. Like ChinaChopper, it parses HTTP requests for the Z1 and Z2 parameters (see Table 4). The legitimate owaauth.dll ﬁle resides in %ProgramFiles%\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\ClientAccess\\Owa\\Auth\\ while CTU researchers have observed the backdoor using the same ﬁlename in the %ProgramFiles%\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\ClientAccess\\Owa\\bin\\ directory. In addition to acting as a web shell, the malware captures and DES-encrypts credentials before writing the username and password to disk. The OwaAuth web shell enables a threat actor to upload and download ﬁles, launch processes, and execute SQL queries. Each web shell instance is conﬁgured to contain SP, Key, and Log variables. The SP variable is a string containing the victim's username. When the malicious ISAPI ﬁlter captures a username matching this variable, it knows to handle the incoming HTTP request as a command to the web shell. The DES key to encrypt the credentials in the conﬁguration observed by CTU researchers is 12345678, and the log ﬁle is c:\\log.txt. The decrypted contents of the log ﬁle adhere to the format in Figure 22. Figure 22. Decrypted OwaAuth log ﬁle format. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) Table 4 lists the OwaAuth web shell commands available to the adversary. Command Functionality A List logical drives B List directory (Z1 = directory name to list) C Read data from ﬁle (Z1 = ﬁlename to read) D Write content to ﬁle (Z1 = ﬁlename to write, Z2 = content to write) E Delete ﬁle in directory (Z1 = ﬁle) F Generate custom web response \"->|value in Z1|<-\" G Write hex-encoded content to ﬁle (Z1 = ﬁlename to write, Z2 = hex encoded content to write) H Call _Notice(Z1, Z2) I Move/rename ﬁle or directory (Z1 = target, Z2 = new name) J Create directory (Z1 = directory name) K Timestomp ﬁle or directory (Z1 = target, Z2 = time/date string to stomp to) L Download ﬁle from Internet (Z1 = URL, Z2 = ﬁlename to write to) M Launch process (Z1 = process name, Z2 = arguments) N Test connect to SQL database (Z1 = SqlConnect String) O SQL Get database table scheme (Z1 = \\r delimited parameters to command) P SQL Get database table scheme with restrictions (Z1 = \\r delimited parameters to command) Q SQL execute SQL command (Z1 = \\r delimited parameters to command) Table 4. OwaAuth web shell command set. (Source: Dell SecureWorks) Appendix D — Domain name parking example CTU researchers have observed TG-3390 parking domains by pointing their A record to a non-routable IP space, including the 127.0.0.[x] loopback address. Table 5 demonstrates how the threat actors change one of their C2 domains to point to routable and non-routable IP addresses over time.

Example parking of trendmicro-update . org (Source: Dell SecureWorks) Endnotes  The Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit(TM) (CTU) research team tracks threat groups by assigning them four-digit randomized numbers (3390 in this case), and compiles information from ﬁrst-hand incident response observations and from external sources. [1]  Threat groups use strategic web compromises (SWCs), also known as watering hole attacks, to target a wide array of potential victims. Threat actors compromise a website used by their target demographic (e.g., compromising a website specializing in oil and gas industry news when targeting the energy vertical). Visitors to the compromised website are redirected to a server under the threat group's control, where their system is compromised with the threat group's malware. With this tactic, a threat group increases the likelihood of compromising systems that possess desired information. [2]  Enjoyed what you read?
