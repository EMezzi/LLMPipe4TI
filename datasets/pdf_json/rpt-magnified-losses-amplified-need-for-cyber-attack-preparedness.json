Effects of losing massive amounts of confidential data to attackers such as substantive financial losses and irreparable reputation damage ran rampant throughout the year. The severity of the attacks and their effects revealed one thing—the risks of becoming the next victim of a cyber attack have gone higher. Various companies suffered financial, legal, operational, and productivity  losses after getting hit by massive data breaches. Breaches across industries aided by point-of-sale (PoS) RAM scrapers, for one, increased in number in 2014. The year was not solely marred by the biggest breaches seen to date though, as attacks targeting vulnerabilities like Heartbleed and Shellshock in widely used, previously considered secure open source software as well as FakeID and Same Origin Policy (SOP) Bypass in mobile devices and platforms were also seen. Established processes like two-factor authentication also proved vulnerable to threats, as evidenced by attacks instigated by the criminals behind Operation Emmental. As years pass, we are bound to see more crippling attacks against both  likely and unlikely targets. Attackers will always trail their sights on one thing—profit. They will continue to indiscriminately hit data gold mines because peddling stolen information is a lucrative business, as evidenced by the thriving cybercriminal underground economy. Merely dealing with threats as they surface is no longer enough, acting  on risk assessment results prior to security incidents is actually more beneficial. Organizations need to rethink their current cybersecurity investments so they can easily respond to and mitigate attacks. Planning ahead so they can instantly take action if they need to is critical because these kinds of cyber attacks can happen to companies in any industry and of whatever size.All in all, it’s a combination  of identifying what’s most important, deploying the right technologies, and educating users. It is everybody’s job–not just that of IT professionals–to ensure that the company’s core data stays safe. —Raimund Genes Trend Micro CTO NOTE: All mentions of “detections” within the text refer to instances when threats were found on users’ computers and subsequently  blocked by any Trend Micro security software. Unless otherwise stated, the figures featured in this report came from data gathered by the Trend Micro  Smart Protection Network  cloud security infrastructure, which uses a combination of in-the-cloud technologies and client-based techniques to support on-premise products and hosted services.TREND MICRO | TrendLabs 2014 Annual Security Roundup5 | Magnified Losses, Amplified Need for Cyber-Attack PreparednessScale of Impact and Losses Due  to Cyber Attacks Intensified Massive data breach disclosures came one after another in 2014 in much more rapid succession than past years. The Sony  Pictures breach illustrated the wide spectrum of losses that can hit a company that has failed to secure its network. As expected, major data breach incidents were  reported as 2014 wore on.1  Retailers, banks, public  utilities, and numerous organizations lost millions of customer data to attackers. Companies across industries succumbed to breaches that not only cost them financially but also brought significant brand damage. 2 In the second quarter of 2014,  for instance, source code repository Code Spaces went out of business after an attacker deleted its client databases and backups. 3 P.F. Chang’s had to  go back to using manual credit-card-imprinting devices after a breach. Outside of the United States, an educational company for children in Japan, Benesse, suffered a major data breach, where a former employee of    a third-party partner  leaked at least 28.95 million customer records to advertisers. As a result, the company had to apologize and allocate part of  its  ¥20-billion fund  (almost US$169 million) to establish the Benesse Children’s Fund. 4 Among the cyber attacks seen in 2014 though, the “Sony Pictures hack” probably best showed how much a company could lose as an aftermath of a security breach. The company was forced to temporarily shut its network down after it was compromised by the so-called Guardians of Peace (GOP). 5   It reportedly lost 100TB of confidential data  as a result.6 While Sony Pictures has not declared  the cost of the breach, cybersecurity experts from the Center of Strategic and International Studies  pegged the loss to reach US$100 million.7–9 Other  companies under the Sony banner have fallen victim to massive attacks. 10 A company executive  was quoted in 2007 as saying he would not invest US$10 million on security technologies to avoid a US$1-million incident. 11 “In order to detect anomalies, however, IT  administrators will need to know first what to look out for. Since attacks are commonly designed to leave little to no tracks at all, it is important to know where possible indicators of a compromise can be found.” —Ziv Chang Director of Cybersafety Solutions “Attackers spend much time during  reconnaissance to understand the target company—its IT environment and security defenses—and IT administrators need to adopt this mentality in terms of their security strategy. All networks are different. This means that each one will need to be configured differently. IT administrators need to fully understand the network and implement the necessary defense measures to fit their environment.” –Spencer Hsieh Targeted Attack Threat ResearcherTREND MICRO | TrendLabs 2014 Annual Security Roundup6 | Magnified Losses, Amplified Need for Cyber-Attack Preparedness All of the reports on who were responsible for the  Sony Pictures hack have so far been inconclusive. Some believe it was an insider job akin to the Amtrak incident motivated by reasons like money, ideology, coercion, or ego. 12–13 Others, meanwhile,  chose to lay the blame on hacktivists. At the end of the day though, it does not matter who was at fault. Had the conglomerate learned from past incidents and protected its network from possible intrusions, it could have spared itself from this situation. 14Even if the truth about how hackers breached Sony Pictures’s defenses remains unknown, our own analysis of WIPALL, the destructive malware the FBI warned businesses against following the Sony Pictures hack, revealed it was not as sophisticated as other classes of malware the likes of STUXNET. 15–17  However, there may be other components of the attack not made public.

In the Code Spaces case, attackers gained access to employee credentials to get inside the company’s network. This could have been prevented through stronger password management policies and employee awareness training. Home Depot claimed that the attackers broke in using credentials stolen from a vendor. This finding highlights the importance of vetting the security practices of partner entities. 18 For Sony, custom defense could have given security defenders a means to detect an intrusion early on, as files are being accessed and deleted or sent outside the network. 19 To do that  though, they should first know their baseline. They should know how their networks are configured and what the systems that comprise them contain so they can spot irregularities or clues of lateral movement. 20TREND MICRO | TrendLabs 2014 Annual Security Roundup8 | Magnified Losses, Amplified Need for Cyber-Attack Preparedness2014 Was the “Year of PoS   RAM Scrapers” PoS RAM scrapers came close to becoming a mainstream threat in 2014, as several high-profile targets lost millions of  customer data to attackers. High-profile targets across a wide variety of  industries were hit by attacks aided by PoS RAM scrapers that allowed cybercriminals to get their hands on millions of customer data. Retailers were no longer the sole PoS system breach targets, as attackers also trailed their sights on hotels, restaurants, and parking lots, among   others. 21–35  Number of Systems Where PoS Malware Were Found in 2014Trend Micro data shows that the number of infected PoS systems in 2014 increased throughout the year.

Development kits specifically for PoS RAM scrapers, in fact, were seen in underground markets, most likely due to the success of PoS-malware-related attacks. 36–37DEC 2013 2014 2015FEBJAN MAR APR MAY JUN JUL SEPAUG OCT NOV DEC JANRETAIL Payment card credentials of up to 40M  customers RETAIL Payment card credentials of approximately 2.6M customers RETAIL Payment card information of customers from 335 shops RETAIL Payment card credentials RESTAURANTS Payment card credentials of customers from 216 storesHOTEL Payment card numbers with security codes and expiration datesRETAIL Credit card credentials of 350,000  customers, 9,200 of which were  fraudulently used BEAUTY Track 2 payment card data with CVV  numbers of <25,000 customers RESTAURANTS Payment card credentials COURIER Payment card data of customers from 51 locations RESTAURANTS Payment card credentials of customers from 395 stores PARKING Payment card details of customers of 17 parking facilities PARKING Credit card credentials RESTAURANTS Payment card credentialsRETAIL Payment card credentials of 56M and  email addresses of 53M customers  RETAIL Payment card numbers RETAIL Payment card credentials of 1.16M  customers RETAIL Credit card credentials PARKING Payment card credentialsTREND MICRO | TrendLabs 2014 Annual Security Roundup11 | Magnified Losses, Amplified Need for Cyber-Attack PreparednessTimeline of PoS RAM Scraper Emergence,   Including Relationships with Other Versions As cybercriminals prospered, however, businesses  continued to suffer the consequences brought on by PoS malware attacks. Companies whose networks were successfully breached spent millions of dollars to rid their systems of the threat and, ultimately, regain their customers’ trust. Though individuals and businesses in the United States suffered most from PoS threats, those from other countries like Canada and the United Kingdom were not spared as well. The United States is at particular risk of credit card fraud due to the low adoption of EMV technology within the country. In response, the biggest financial institutions  worldwide, including American Express, Visa, MasterCard, and Discover, have started shifting the liability from fraudulent transaction theft to merchants if these merchants do not adopt EMV payment terminals. Solutions like shifting to chip-and-pin or EMV cards, along with other reforms, have also been suggested. Properly implemented, EMV usage can make credit card fraud significantly harder to monetize.Single-purpose systems like PoS devices were not readily thought to be targets by cybercriminals and threat actors but proved to be massively profitable if attacks against them succeed. This can signal increased interest in similar standalone equipment like industrial control systems (ICS) and SCADA-related devices as well. 38–41 For retailers, hotels, restaurants, and other service providers that heavily rely on PoS systems in their day-to-day business, it will be worth examining the possible entry points that attackers can take advantage of. This also means that not only should these companies lock down PoS security through application control technology in order to limit the execution of programs to only those that PoS systems should be using, but companies should also look at the different parts of the entire network that attackers can breach. Technologies that provide advanced network security threat detection and real-time intelligence can increase the chances of detecting intrusions.2009 20112010 2012 2013 2014 2015Alina BlackPOS Dexter VSkimmer Soraya ChewBacca LusyPOS Decebal JackPOS BlackPOS 2 Backoﬀ BrutPOSRawPOS Rdasrv NewPoSThings GetMyPassTREND MICRO | TrendLabs 2014 Annual Security Roundup12 | Magnified Losses, Amplified Need for Cyber-Attack PreparednessHeartbleed and Shellshock Proved That  No Application Was Invulnerable Software and platforms previously considered secure proved otherwise in 2014. Though it was true that the number of major  zero-day exploits declined in 2014 compared with previous years, the severity of the threats that surfaced did not diminish. 42 Gaping security holes  “No matter how many zero days or Heartbleed-/Shellshock-type vulnerabilities we may see, we  should never forget that the fundamental vulnerabilities in Web applications such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), broken authentication, etc., are still very prevalent. They are, quite often, the reason behind the big data breaches that occur. Also, we should never forget the best practices on controlling access to data, encrypting it as much as we can, ensuring the right security products are in place, quickly shielding against vulnerabilities.” –Pawan Kinger Director of Deep Security Labs that were left unpatched in widely used software and platforms continued to be exploited to instigate attacks that rendered targets defenseless.

An overwhelming majority of supercomputers, which are primarily used by research facilities, academia, and other sectors that require ultra-fast computing power, use Linux as well. 45–46 Comparison of Windows of Exposure of High-Profile   Vulnerabilities Disclosed in 2014The fact that Linux is widely used as a server platform means Heartbleed and Shellshock put massive amounts of data at risk. If these servers are attacked, their owners could suffer crippling effects. Affected server owners would have to spend a lot of money paying staff to patch vulnerable systems. Patching could also cause system downtime, which could translate to revenue loss. Open source initiatives can greatly benefit from a  more stringent review process in keeping with quality assurance as part of a good software development life cycle. Because of the pervasive impact of these kinds of vulnerabilities, affected companies and individuals should consider vulnerability protection technologies that can provide virtual patches for vulnerable software before a vendor does so. 20092004199919941989 2014UNKNOWNRisk: MEDIUM Risk: CRITICAL Exposure: 9,241 Exposure: 828 Exposure after ﬁrst attack:1Exposure after ﬁrst attack: UNKNOWNBASH (SHELLSHOCK)OPENSSL (HEARTBLEED) JUN. 8, 1989 SEP. 26, 2014 SEP. 25, 201425+ YEARS 2+ YEARS DEC. 31, 2011 APR. 7, 2014 Vulnerability existing Patch date Exploit releasedTREND MICRO | TrendLabs 2014 Annual Security Roundup14 | Magnified Losses, Amplified Need for Cyber-Attack PreparednessOnline and Mobile Banking Faced  Bigger Security Challenges Operation Emmental proved that two-factor authentication was no longer enough to secure sensitive transactions, while online  banking Trojans and malicious mobile apps continued to be a problem.  Online and mobile banking took off worldwide,  especially in technologically advanced countries though steps to secure transactions were not able to keep pace. 47 Multifactor authentication has not  yet been widely adopted.48 Even users have yet to  fully grasp the concept of securing their financial transactions. They still fall for social engineering lures cleverly crafted to trick them into giving out sensitive information like their account numbers, usernames, or passwords. The convenience that online and mobile banking  offers comes with risks. In fact, cybercriminals continuously devise ways to try to steal from bank customers. Those behind one particular operation we have dubbed “Emmental” have, in fact, even proven that two-factor authentication could be circumvented. 49 Incremental increases month over month were seen in the number of online banking malware throughout the last quarter of 2014. Notorious online banking malware like ZeuS/ZBOT continuously lined cybercriminals’ pockets with millions of dollars in stolen cash. 50 They  have constantly been enhanced throughout the years to keep up with online banking security improvements. And this fact is not expected to change because online and mobile banking users, individuals and companies alike, constantly prove to be lucrative cybercrime targets. “The malware that the attackers used  revealed a weakness in single-session token protection strategies. Banks and other organizations that continue to use these are exposing themselves and their customers to rogue mobile apps. More advanced defenses, which include the use of multiple transaction authentication numbers (TANs), photo-TANs, and card readers, should be considered.”  —David Sancho, Feike  Hacquebord, and Rainer Link Senior Threat Researchers Number of Computers Where Online  Banking Malware Were Found in 2014 150K 75K 0 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q 102K112K145K 137KTREND MICRO | TrendLabs 2014 Annual Security Roundup15 | Magnified Losses, Amplified Need for Cyber-Attack PreparednessThreats that ran on computers were not the only  ones online and mobile banking users worried about though. They also had to stay protected from mobile malware and high-risk apps. Along with the increased adoption of mobile banking came more fake banking apps that aimed to steal not just users’ banking credentials but also the money saved in their accounts. Case in point, the number of Android  malware and high-risk apps continuously increased throughout 2014. A fourfold increase in the number of banking- or finance-related malware for the Android platform alone was also seen.Cumulative Number of Android  Malware in 2014 Number of Mobile Banking/Financial Malware Note: Banking-/Finance-related mobile apps refer to malicious apps that aim to steal victims’  financial information.

Some examples of  these were WireLurker and Masque, which could infect even nonjailbroken devices. iOS Malware Count New mobile vulnerabilities like FakeID and SOP also caused security woes in 2014. 51–52 Bugs like  FakeID could pass off malicious mobile banking apps as legitimate, which could lead to disastrous consequences. Companies that end up as banking fraud victims  stand to lose a lot of money if made to reimburse customers’ stolen money in cases of qualified fraud. Even worse, they could lose their customers’ trust if the latter do not feel they are as protected as they should be. 53 Banks and other financial institutions should consider multifactor authentication in order to set more roadblocks against cybercriminals meaning to intercept bank-to-customer communication. Companies at risk should also be proactive in informing customers on how to improve their computer security—through the use of security software and good password management practices—if they have knowledge of attacks that are victimizing their or other banks’ account holders.  As to users of mobile devices, only download  applications from official app stores, and even then, take the time to check out the developer and read app reviews prior to download, whether the device used runs on Android or iOS. 10 5 0 OCT NOV DEC JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV 2013 2014 1 1 15 479TREND MICRO | TrendLabs 2014 Annual Security Roundup17 | Magnified Losses, Amplified Need for Cyber-Attack PreparednessRansomware Became a Bigger  and More Sophisticated Threat Ransomware spread more malice across regions and segments. And unlike older variants, they no longer just issue empty  threats but actually encrypt files. Ransomware, now capable of actually encrypting  files held for ransom instead of just issuing empty threats, have crossed borders. 54–57 They can now be  found in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) after spreading mayhem in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa as well as Japan. More recent variants of the threat have moved beyond focusing on a single segment as well, as perpetrators victimized consumers and small businesses alike. Although the number of detected ransomware  declined from 2013 to 2014, related infections remained destructive. And while traditional ransomware like REVETON and RANSOM dominated 2013 with a 97% share, crypto-ransomware took the stage in 2014, as their share increased 27.35%. “While not presenting anything new to  the table, CryptoLocker has taken the scare tactics effectively used before by ransomware and fake antivirus attacks to a new level. Most users rely nowadays on good antimalware, but it is important to note that user education, regular software updates, and strict computer usage policies are crucial in defending against CryptoLocker and similar threats.” –Jay Yaneza Threat Analyst Number of Computers Where Ransomware Were Found, 2013 Versus 2014 100K 50K 0 2013 2014 84K 48K 15K 2KNumber of crypto-ransomwareTREND MICRO | TrendLabs 2014 Annual Security Roundup18 | Magnified Losses, Amplified Need for Cyber-Attack PreparednessNumber of Computers Where Ransomware Were Found by Quarter Country Distribution of Ransomware Detections, 2013 Versus 2014 30K 15K 0 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q 1QCryptoLocker ﬁrst emerges 2Q 3Q 4Q 2014 2013 9K 9K11K15K20K21K 16K29K United States JapanGermanyAustraliaTurkeyItalyFranceCanadaPhilippinesUnited KingdomOthers35.93% 19.94% 6.39% 5.67% 3.19% 2.49% 2.00% 1.87% 1.70% 1.64% 19.18%United StatesJapanAustraliaGermanyTurkeyIndiaCanadaFranceUnited KingdomItalyOthers41.81% 16.11% 6.42% 3.98% 3.35% 2.51% 2.24% 2.19% 1.95% 1.85% 17.59%2013 84K 48K2014TREND MICRO | TrendLabs 2014 Annual Security Roundup19 | Magnified Losses, Amplified Need for Cyber-Attack PreparednessRansomware Family Distribution, 2013 Versus 2014 The share of ransomware-infected systems in the United States, Australia, Turkey, India, Canada, France,  and the United Kingdom increased from 2013 to 2014.

We have been tracking developments in  the cybercriminal underground economy to better understand cybercrime motivations. Unsurprisingly, financial profit is the biggest if not the sole driver of the different cybercriminal hubs springing up around the world. Like any developing real-world economy, the cybercriminal underground thrives on constantly improving specializations and activities related to setting up and running cybercriminal operations. Credit Card Prices in the Russian Cybercriminal Underground by YearOn one hand are suppliers of products and services—blackhat developers of Trojan builders and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) tools as well as owners of massive credit card dumps—while on the other are buyers with specific needs who can choose from among different vendors. Throughout the years, the prices of different underground products and services have been influenced by market forces—as the supply increases,   prices decrease. 2011 2012 2013 2014US$10 US$5 0USA AUSCANGER UK2011 US$2.50 US$7.00 US$5.00 US$9.00 US$7.002012 US$1.00 US$5.00US$5.00 US$7.00 US$8.002013 US$1.00 US$4.00 US$6.00 US$9.00 US$5.002014 US$2.50 US$4.50 US$4.00 US$3.00 US$4.50 TREND MICRO | TrendLabs 2014 Annual Security Roundup25 | Magnified Losses, Amplified Need for Cyber-Attack PreparednessWhile several commonalities among regional  cybercriminal underground markets exist, each tends to develop in slightly different ways. The Russian underground, for instance, is notorious for trading traffic direction systems (TDSs) and pay-per-install services—business models that drive the volume of grayware and adware in victims’ computers upward, alongside commissions. The Chinese cybercriminal underground, meanwhile, is much more fixated on mobile fraud, with hardware setups that can send SMS spam to thousands of potential victims in under an hour. Finally, the Brazilian underground is known for phishing banks and, more notably, a 10-module training course for cybercriminal newbies on how to commit fraud. Most of the cybercriminal  communications on the surface Web are relatively well-hidden through the use of forums or encrypted social media posts. However, anonymity is such a key factor in a cybercriminal’s longevity in the business that the use of darknets in the Deep Web has become significant as well. After the Silkroad takedown in 2013, in fact, a lot of players were expected to try and take the place of Dread Pirate Roberts. Different marketplaces emerged in 2014 while law enforcement played cat and mouse with unsearchable websites as in an operation called “Operation Onymous,” which brought down 17 alleged operators. 59 Cryptocurrencies also play  a large role in the Deep Web, and in 2014 we saw   “Operation Pawn Storm used next-level  spear-phishing tactics to obtain the email credentials of primarily military, embassy, and defense contractor personnel from the United States and its allies. The threat actors used a mix of spear-phishing emails and specially crafted Webmail service phishing websites to gain access to victims’ inboxes in hopes of getting better footholds inside target organizations.” —Loucif Kharouni, Feike  Hacquebord, Numaan Huq,  Jim Gogolinski, Fernando  Mercês, Alfred Remorin, and   Douglas Otis  Senior Threat Researchers a new cryptocurrency called “Cloakcoins,” which, unlike Bitcoins, offer complete untraceability of the transaction chain. 60 Even in the clandestine world of targeted attack campaigns launched by a different breed of threat actors, the emergence of international players was evident. While cybercriminals primarily pursued monetary profit, threat actors worldwide realized the value of stealing corporate data,  intellectual property, and other trade secrets. The diversity of targets and locations of targeted-attack-related command-and-control (C&C) servers do not suggest a single dominant player when it comes to espionage. Targets as diverse as telecommunications  companies, manufacturing firms, governments, and media outfits continued to be seen. Campaigns like Regin targeted victims in Belgium; Operation Pawn Storm in the United  States, Hungary, and Austria; and Plead in Taiwan. Companies assessing their risk levels should  take into account all kinds of possible intruders, including those who target them across the planet. As cybercrime becomes more attractive to the unscrupulous and as targeted attack campaigns become much easier to mount, the pressure to reassess the breadth and quality of cybersecurity investments must only intensify.TREND MICRO | TrendLabs 2014 Annual Security Roundup26 | Magnified Losses, Amplified Need for Cyber-Attack PreparednessOverall Threat Volumes Decrease,  but Phishing Almost Doubles Trend Micro Smart Protection Network telemetry showed a general decrease in the volume of threat components like malicious  domains and spam, but malware continued to be important tools in cybercriminal operations. Phishing sites almost doubled in number this year. Quality over quantity was a resounding theme  in the 2014 threat landscape, reflected in part by the overall volume of malicious components we identified and blocked throughout the year. Web threats largely remained multicomponent in nature. However, as security events proved, attackers continued to fine-tune their strategies even if these were not original to obtain not just more victims but more desirable ones.Number of Email Reputation   Queries Blocked as Spam Blocking spam-sending IP addresses is a crucial step in breaking infection chains. Emails haphazardly sent to huge mailing lists remained part of the threat landscape, albeit as white noise. Trend Micro spam filters were able to easily weed them out though, as we detected 50 billion email reputation queries—slightly lower than the numbers seen in 2012 and 2013 but still fairly significant—as spam.Volume of Spam Blocked by   Messaging Products Note: This data set is from Trend Micro messaging  product feedback.We were also able to block spam based on content,  alongside the reputation of the sender. Based on data from Trend Micro messaging products, the volume of spam tended to be stable, with a slight uptick in the third quarter of 2014. 80B 40B 0 2012 2013 2014 67B 50B69B 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q12T 6T 0 9T 8T 8T11TTREND MICRO | TrendLabs 2014 Annual Security Roundup27 | Magnified Losses, Amplified Need for Cyber-Attack PreparednessTop 10 Spam Languages in  2013 and 2014  English ChineseJapaneseGermanRussianPortugueseSpanishIcelandicItalianFrenchOthers87.14% 2.36% 1.84% 1.48% 1.20% 0.28% 0.21%0.12% 0.10%0.10% 5.17% EnglishGermanJapaneseChineseRussianPortuguesePolishSpanishFrenchItalianOthers85.84% 3.29% 1.87% 1.84% 0.85% 0.41% 0.37% 0.32% 0.29% 0.12% 4.80%2013 2014 English remained spammers’ most preferred  language even though its overall share decreased from 2013’s 87.14%. This means we saw slightly more non-English spam in 2014. Among the non-English spam, those written in German topped the list, toppling Chinese and Japanese.TREND MICRO | TrendLabs 2014 Annual Security Roundup28 | Magnified Losses, Amplified Need for Cyber-Attack PreparednessTop Spam-Sending Countries, 2013 Versus 2014 The United States and Spain were the most active  spam senders, as in 2013, despite posting relatively smaller shares. A spike in the salad spam volume was seen in Spain, Germany, Italy, and Iran, which could have further contributed to the 2014 spam language distribution. 61 Spammers also made full use of other channels like social networking sites in 2014 with the same end goal—to get as many valuable clicks as possible. For instance, in our investigation of Twitter abuse, we saw how attackers can use social platforms to lure people. 62 Webmail clients also helped spammers  slip through spam filters because network communications were likely encrypted. This is precisely why the ability to block malicious URLs, IP addresses, and domains is critical to an enterprise’s security arsenal. Should a spam slip through or use social media or Webmail, URL-blocking technology should be able to catch a user’s wayward click before it accesses a malicious remote location. URLs can serve as phishing landing pages,  redirectors, malware download locations, and thus are the lifeblood of any cybercriminal operation. In 2014, we were able to block close to 4 billion user queries from accessing malicious sites, or up to 7,000 clicks per minute.
