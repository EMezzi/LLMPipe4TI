The group, known to Symantec asTick, has maintained a low proﬁle, appearing to be active for at least 10 years prior to discovery.In its most recent campaign, Tick employed spear-phishing emails and compromised a numberof Japanese websites in order to infect a new wave of victims. The group is highly selective inits approach and only appears to deploy its full range of tools once it establishes that thecompromised organization is an intended target. Tick also uses a range of hacktools to map thevictim’s network and attempt to escalate privileges further.Daserf’s main purpose is information stealing and the Trojan is capable of gathering informationfrom infected computers and relaying it back to attacker-controlled servers. Tick’s most recentattacks have concentrated on the technology, aquatic engineering, and broadcasting sectors inJapan.Recent attacksSymantec discovered the most recent wave of Tick attacks in July 2015, when the groupcompromised three different Japanese websites with a Flash (.swf) exploit to mount wateringhole attacks. Visitors to these websites were infected with a downloader known as Gofarer(Downloader.Gofarer). Gofarer collects information about the compromised computer and thendownloads and installs Daserf.Tick also used spear-phishing emails in these recent attacks. While Symantec did not ﬁnd theemails themselves, it did identify the use of an exploit designed to take advantage of avulnerability in Microsoft Office documents (CVE-2014-4114). This was used to distributemalware in addition to the watering hole activity.Tick under the microscopeDaserf appears to be custom-developed for use in Tick’s cyberespionage campaigns. Onceinstalled, it establishes a remote connection to Tick’s command and control server, providingthe attacker with access to the compromised computer.0 Favorited2 Views0 Files0 Shares0 Downloads01/04/24, 16:45Endpoint Protection - Symantec Enterprise Pagina 2 di 4https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/…Key=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments Figure 1. Chain of infection seen in recent Japanese attacksOnce the malware is installed on a targeted computer, the attackers attempt to enumerate thenetwork and escalate their privilege level. To do this, Tick uses a number of publicly availablehacktools such as Mimikatz, GSecdump, and Windows Credential Editor. The tools aredownloaded and deployed to the original install directory previously created by the malware.Tick’s primary objective appears to be the theft of sensitive information from targeted Japaneseorganizations. To date, Symantec has observed the group attempting to steal emails anddocuments such as PowerPoint presentations.Low-profile threatThe Daserf Trojan employs a number of tactics to avoid detection. Once collected, the stolendata is hidden in password-protected .rar archives.Daserf also uses ﬁle and folder names related to legitimate programs often found in Windowsenvironments in order to blend in. Observed folder names include HP, Intel, Adobe, and perﬂogsand folders are generally created in either the root drive or the Application Data or ProgramFiles folders. File names used in recent attacks include adobe.exe, adobe_sl.exe, intel.exe, andintellog.exe.Command and control serversTick uses compromised web servers to distribute malware and, in some instances, for itscommand and control (C&C) infrastructure. However, in most cases, it relies on its owninfrastructure for C&C purposes.In its most recent campaigns, the group registered the domains used for C&C servers days afterthe malware was compiled. For example, one of the variants of Daserf used was compiled onJuly 8, 2015. This sample was seen contacting the C&C domain www[.]dreamsig[.]com, whichwas ﬁrst registered on July 13, 2015, ﬁve days after the compilation date. This pattern occurredin multiple Daserf samples.Another interesting aspect of the communication between the malware and the C&Cinfrastructure is how the malware changes the URL from a randomly chosen variable selectedfrom a predeﬁned list.Predefined list from Daserf MD5: 765017E16842C9EB6860A7E9F711B0DBrjdyw.aspxszgj.aspdheyf.aspejdhf.aspgxbne.aspswetf.aspqgfhr.aspwhjdh.aspzgfer.aspcshyr.aspfxkle.asptmwry.aspviksr.aspycghw.aspTable 1. An example of how a Daserf sample uses a predeﬁned list of URLs embedded in themalwareSymantec identiﬁed multiple C&C domains used by Tick. Unfortunately, Tick frequently usedeither privacy protection services or domain brokers to mask registration information. Thesetactics are used to make discovery and attribution more difficult.01/04/24, 16:45Endpoint Protection - Symantec Enterprise Pagina 3 di 4https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/…Key=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocumentsC&C domainParent hashcharlie-harada[.]com122652ca6ef719f8ba2d8d412ea184feisozaki.sakura.ne[.]jp4601e75267d0dcfe4256c43f45ec470awww.aucsellers[.]com7ec173d469c2aa7a3a15acb03214256cwww.lunwe[.]com8d5bf506e55ab736f4c018d15739e352c-saika[.]jp3fa5965a1de2c095de38f22f0645af3eb33f4b8e776b94dc48c234ce9897cf74kcm-store[.]com63fe9f06068823b02b925e4a74a57db0htpc[.]jpa629926313ee12163e1bdd2bb633e0e2d3031438d80913f21ec6d3078dc77068rlsolar[.]jpd3031438d80913f21ec6d3078dc77068Table 2. Examples of Tick C&C domains and associated MD5 hashesStolen digital certificates used in selected casesThe majority of the malware analyzed was not digitally signed. However, a small percentage wassigned with a stolen digital certiﬁcate. It is unclear why the certiﬁcate was used so sparingly,since signed malware would receive a greater level of trust and reduce the risk of detection. It is possible that the certiﬁcate was used against a target that had a secure environmentwhich may have required binaries to be signed in order to interact with the operating system.The issuer of the certiﬁcate has been informed of its misuse and conﬁrmed that it would berevoked. Figure 2. The stolen digital certiﬁcate used to sign Tick malwareTargetsThe use of compromised websites to infect victims results in unintentional infections, making itdifficult to identify the motives of the attacker. By searching for evidence of post-infectionactivity, Symantec identiﬁed seven organizations where Tick had mounted persistent post-compromise attacks. These organizations were primarily large Japanese technology,engineering, and media ﬁrms.  Figure 3. Daserf infections by regionThe seven organizations therefore appear to be Tick’s intended targets. In addition to seeingpost-compromise tools used in these attacks, the length of time the attackers were active onthe networks provided additional evidence that these were high-value targets. The longest timeTick was active in a victim’s environment was 18 months. The average timeframe was ﬁvemonths and the number of infected hosts in a victim’s network ranged from 3 to 15 systems.ConclusionTick has left a trail of evidence indicating that its activity began as early as 2006. In earlierattacks, the group used malicious Microsoft Word documents to infect victims, withcompromised websites being added to the mix as a more recent attack vector.Tick appears to be a well-organized group, with the funding and capability to develop andupdate its malware. It has the ability to compromise legitimate infrastructure to use for malwaredistribution and has access to stolen digital certiﬁcates to sign its malware when needed. Tickprimarily uses purchased infrastructure for its C&C servers and has been able to stay off theradar since 2006. 01/04/24, 16:45Endpoint Protection - Symantec Enterprise Pagina 4 di 4https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities…Key=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocumentsTick exhibits all the hallmarks of an advanced cyberespionage group. The long lifespan of thegroup, as well as the consistent targeted attacks against speciﬁc industries, support this theory.The individuals or organization behind Tick’s operations has an interest in Japanese technologyalong with Japanese media and broadcasting organizations. While Tick’s tactics may changeover time, the group’s history indicates that its focus will continue to be a narrow range oftargets, mainly in Japan.ProtectionSymantec and Norton products protect against these threats with the following detections:AntivirusBackdoor.DaserfBackdoor.Daserf!gen1Backdoor.Daserf.BDownloader.GofarerDownloader.Gofarer!g1Downloader.Gofarer!g2Downloader.Gofarer!g3Intrusion prevention systemSystem Infected: Backdoor.Daserf.BTags and KeywordsRelated Entries and LinksNo Related Resource entered.
