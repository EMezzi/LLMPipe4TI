According to thedeveloper, PupyRAT is a “multi-platform(Windows, Linux, OSX, Android), multi-function RAT and post-exploitation toolmainly written in Python.” CTU analysis confirms that PupyRAT can givethe threat actor full access to thevictim's system.ConclusionCTU analysis suggests this activity isrelated to Iranian threat actors closelyaligned with or acting on behalf of theCOBALT GYPSY threat group (formerlylabeled Threat Group-2889). CTUresearchers assess with high confidencethat COBALT GYPSY is associated withIranian government-directed cyberoperations, and it has used tacticssimilar to this campaign:targeting Saudi financial, oil, andtechnology organizationsusing job-themed lures to infectsystemsregistering spoofed domainsspearphishing new victims usinglegitimate email addressesThis campaign highlights the need fororganizations to educate users aboutthe risks of spearphishing and shortenedlinks.

A \"highconfidence\" judgment is not a fact ora certainty, however, and suchjudgments still carry a risk of beingwrong.Moderate confidence generallymeans that the information is crediblysourced and plausible but not ofsufficient quality or corroboratedsufficiently to warrant a higher levelof confidence.Low confidence generally means thatthe information's credibility and/orplausibility is questionable, or that theinformation is too fragmented orpoorly corroborated to make solidanalytic inferences, or that [there are]significant concerns or problems withthe sources.TAGS:ResearchBlogBACK TO ALL BLOGS01/04/24, 21:08Iranian PupyRAT Bites Middle Eastern Organizations | Secureworks Pagina 10 di 13https://www.secureworks.com/blog/iranian-pupyrat-bites-middle-eastern-organizationsADDITIONAL RESOURCES BLOGFIVE KEYS TO MAXIMIZING MDR VALUEREAD NOW BLOGUNRAVELLING THE ATTACK SURFACE OF AISYSTEMSREAD NOW01/04/24, 21:08Iranian PupyRAT Bites Middle Eastern Organizations | Secureworks Pagina 11 di 13https://www.secureworks.com/blog/iranian-pupyrat-bites-middle-eastern-organizationsPRODUCTSSERVICESRESOURCES Get the latest updates and news fromSecureworks.SUBSCRIBE NOWTRY TAEGIS01/04/24, 21:08Iranian PupyRAT Bites Middle Eastern Organizations | Secureworks Pagina 12 di 13https://www.secureworks.com/blog/iranian-pupyrat-bites-middle-eastern-organizationsPRODUCTSDetection & Response Endpoint SecurityNetwork SecurityOT SecurityVulnerability ManagementWHY SECUREWORKSSERVICESAccess Plan Battle Test ExerciseIncident ResponseSOLUTIONSIndustriesNeedRESOURCES GET IN TOUCH  2024 Secureworks, Inc.Privacy PolicySupply Chain TransparencyTerms and ConditionsAccessibility StatementUnsubscribeCookie Settings XDR MDR Threat Hunting Log Management MITRE ATT&CK Coverage EDR NGAV IDPS Operational Technology Vulnerability Risk Prioritization Why Secureworks At Your Side Compare Secureworks Artifical Intelligence ROI Calculator Corporate Responsibility Corporate Overview Careers Investor Relations Threat Hunting Assessment Vulnerability Assessment Ransomware ReadinessAssessment Penetration Testing Adversary Exercises Application Security Testing About Emergency IncidentResponse Emergency Breach Hotline Education Industry Financial Industry Manufacturing Industry Accelerate Security Maturity Consolidate Security Tools Microsoft Security Monitor IT and OT Reduce Teams Burden Blog Cybersecurity Glossary Resource Library Case Studies Data Sheets Industry Reports In the News Knowledge Center Library Live Events Threat Resource Library Threat Profiles White Papers Webinars Podcasts Videos Experiencing a Breach Contact Support Login01/04/24, 21:08Iranian PupyRAT Bites Middle Eastern Organizations | Secureworks Pagina 13 di 13https://www.secureworks.com/blog/iranian-pupyrat-bites-middle-eastern-organizations"
