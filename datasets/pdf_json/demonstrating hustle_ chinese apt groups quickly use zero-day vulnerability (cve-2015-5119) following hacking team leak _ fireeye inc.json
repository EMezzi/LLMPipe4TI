Once the new update is installed, Flash should function no rmally. Up date Outlook Many Fla sh problems can be solved by updating yo ur client software to the late st version. Plea se verify that yo u have all the late st updates available fo r your version of a dobe flash software. Here's how: 1.Download update hxxp://get[.]a dobe[.]com/ (masked URL: hxxp:// 137.175.4[.]132/index.htm) 2.Click Check fo r Updates. 3.Restart your computer after you have ve rified that all updates are installed.

SUBSCR IBE Crescendo: Real Time Event Vie wer for macOS   Ransomware again st the Machine: How adversaries are Learning to Disrupt Industrial Production by Targeting IT and OT  M-Trends 2020 : Insights From the Front Line s    The FireEye as a Service team detected independent phishing campaigns conducted by two Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) groups that we track, APT3 and APT18. Each threat group quickly took advantage of a zero-day vulnerability (CVE- 2015-5119), which was leaked in the disclosure of Hacking Team’s internal data. Adobe released a patch  for the vulnerability on July 8, 2015. Before that patch was released, the groups launched phishing campaigns against multiple companies in the aerospace and defense, construction and engineering, education, energy, health and biotechnology, high tech, non-profit, telecommunications, and transportation industries. Home  FireEye Blog s Threat Research  Demon strating Hustle, Chine se aPT G roups Quickly U...    Solutions Services Customers Partners Resources Company  Compa ring the Campaign s aPT3 and aPT18 took a slightly different app roach in employing the exploit, which demonstrates they likely work independently. a s usual, aPT3 used compromised infrastructure, while aPT 18 relied on procured infrastructure. aPT3 used customized phishing email s that sometime s containe d the name s of the ta rgeted organizations, whereas aPT18’s emails were nonspecific an d likely crafted to be used on multiple ta rgets. Quick Turnaround Time Demon strates adaptability an d Opportunism The groups demonstrated their adaptability an d skill by q uickly employing Hacking Team’ s leaked zero-day before the vulnerability was patche d. Both g roups likely monito r information f rom security research to lea rn what exploit s are available an d how network defenders are reacting to them. We have p reviously observed aPT3 monito ring and quickly changing tactic s based on public research. afte r we exposed details about Operation Clan destine Wolf, aPT 3 change d its phishing email s, modified filename s, and updated its backdoor. In the pa st, aPT3 and aPT18 have frequently develope d or adapted zero-day exploit s for operations, which were likely planne d in advance. U sing data from the Hacking Team leak demonstrates how they can shift resources—selecting ta rgets, preparing infrastructure, crafting me ssages, and updating tool s—to take a dvantage of unexpecte d opportunities like newly expo sed exploit s. Recommen dations FireEye maintain s endpoint an d network detection fo r CVE-2015 -5119, the back doors used in these campaign s, and other tools used by the se groups. additionally, we highly recommen d: applying a dobe’s patch  for Flash imme diately, Querying for additional activity by source addresses or email in dicators, Blocking CnC a ddresses via outbound communication s, and Scope the envi ronment to p repare for incident response. note: IOCs for this campaign can be fo und here.
