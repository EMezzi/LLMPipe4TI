Over 10 days, Wells approved a total of at least 12 transfers ofBDA funds requested over the secure SWIFT system.The SWIFT network - which allows banks to process billions of dollars in transfers each Special Report - Cyber thievesexploit banks' faith in SWIFTtransfer networkBy Tom Bergin and Nathan LayneMay 20, 2016 9:19 PM GMT+2 · Updated 8 years agoWorld01/04/24, 21:00Special Report - Cyber thieves exploit banks' faith in SWIFT transfer network | Reuters Pagina 2 di 10https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-heist-swift-specialreport-idUSKCN0YB0DD/day - is considered the backbone of international banking.

Wells Fargo, which also initially declined comment on thelawsuit, said in a statement to Reuters on Friday that it \"properly processed the wireinstructions received via authenticated SWIFT messages\" and was not responsible forBDA's losses.Advertisement · Scroll to continue BDA is suing Wells Fargo on the basis that the U.S. bank should have ﬂagged thetransactions as suspicious.Wells Fargo has countered that security lapses in BDA’s own operations caused theEcuadorean bank’s losses.

Neither bank reported the theft to SWIFT, which said it ﬁrst learned about the cyberattack from a Reuters inquiry.\"We were not aware,” SWIFT said in a statement responding to Reuters inquiries. “Weneed to be informed by customers of such frauds if they relate to our products andservices, so that we can inform and support the wider community. We have been intouch with the bank concerned to get more information, and are reminding customers oftheir obligations to share such information with us.\"Advertisement · Scroll to continue SWIFT says it requires customer to notify SWIFT of problems that can affect the\"conﬁdentiality, integrity, or availability of SWIFT service.”SWIFT, however, has no rule speciﬁcally requiring client banks to report hacking thefts.Banks often do not report such attacks out of concern they make the institution appearvulnerable, former SWIFT employees and cyber security experts told Reuters.The Ecuador case illuminates a central problem with preventing such fraudulenttransfers: Neither SWIFT nor its client banks have a full picture of the frequency or theReport this ad01/04/24, 21:00Special Report - Cyber thieves exploit banks' faith in SWIFT transfer network | Reuters Pagina 4 di 10https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-heist-swift-specialreport-idUSKCN0YB0DD/details of cyber thefts made through the network, according to more than dozen formerSWIFT executives, users and cyber security experts interviewed by Reuters.The case - details of which have not been previously reported - raises new questionsabout the oversight of the SWIFT network and its communications with member banksabout cyber thefts and risks. The network has faced intense scrutiny since cyber thievesstole $81 million (£56 million) in February from a Bangladesh central bank account atthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York.It’s unclear what SWIFT tells its member banks when it does ﬁnd out about cyber thefts,which are typically ﬁrst discovered by the bank that has been defrauded. SWIFTspokeswoman Natasha de Terán said that the organisation “was transparent with itsusers” but declined to elaborate. SWIFT declined to answer speciﬁc questions about itspolicies for disclosing breaches.On Friday, following the publication of this Reuters story, SWIFT urged all of its users tonotify the network of cyber attacks.\"It is essential that you share critical security information related to SWIFT with us,\"SWIFT said in a communication to users.Reuters was unable to determine the number or frequency of cyber attacks involving theSWIFT system, or how often the banks report them to SWIFT ofﬁcials.The lack of disclosure may foster overconﬁdence in SWIFT network security by banks,which routinely approve transfer requests made through the messaging networkwithout additional veriﬁcation, former SWIFT employees and cyber security experts said.The criminals behind such heists are exploiting banks’ willingness to approve SWIFTrequests at face value, rather than making additional manual or automated checks,said John Doyle, who held a variety of senior roles at SWIFT between 1980 and 2005.“SWIFT doesn’t replace prudent banking practice” he said, noting that banks shouldverify the authenticity of withdrawal or transfer requests, as they would for moneytransfers outside the SWIFT system.SWIFT commits to checking the codes on messages sent into its system, to ensure themessage has originated from a client’s terminal, and to send it to the intended recipientquickly and securely, former SWIFT executives and cyber security experts said. But oncecyber-thieves obtain legitimate codes and credentials, they said, SWIFT has no way ofknowing they are not the true account holders.The Bank for International Settlements, a trade body for central banks, said in aNovember report that increased information sharing on cyber attacks is crucial tohelping ﬁnancial institutions manage the risk.“The more they share the better,” said Leo Taddeo, chief security ofﬁcer at Cryptzoneand a former special agent in charge with the FBI's cyber crime division in New York.SYSTEMIC RISKSWIFT, a cooperative owned and governed by representatives of the banks it serves, wasfounded in 1973 and operates a secure messaging network that has been consideredreliable for four decades. But recent attacks involving the Belgium-based cooperativehave underscored how the network's central role in global ﬁnance also presentssystemic risk.SWIFT is not regulated, but a group of ten central banks from developed nations, led bythe National Bank of Belgium, oversee the organisation. Among its stated guidelines is a Report this ad01/04/24, 21:00Special Report - Cyber thieves exploit banks' faith in SWIFT transfer network | Reuters Pagina 5 di 10https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-heist-swift-specialreport-idUSKCN0YB0DD/requirement to provide clients with enough information to enable them “to manageadequately the risks related to their use of SWIFT.”However, some former SWIFT employees said that the cooperative struggles to keepbanks informed on risks of cyber fraud because of a lack of cooperation from the banksthemselves. SWIFT’s 25-member board of directors is ﬁlled with representatives oflarger banks.“The banks are not going to tell us too much,” said Doyle, the former SWIFTexecutive. “They wouldn’t like to destabilise conﬁdence in their institution.”Banks also fear notifying SWIFT or law enforcement of security breaches because thatcould lead to regulatory investigations that highlight failures of risk management orcompliance that could embarrass top managers, said Hugh Cumberland, a formerSWIFT marketing executive who is now a senior associate with cyber security ﬁrm Post-Quantum.Cases of unauthorised money transfers rarely become public, in part becausedisagreements are usually settled bilaterally or through arbitration, which is typicallyprivate, said Salvatore Scanio, a lawyer at Washington, D.C.-based Ludwig & Robinson.Scanio said he consulted on a dispute involving millions of dollars of stolen funds andthe sending of fraudulent SWIFT messages similar to the BDA attack. He declined toname the parties or provide other details.Theoretically, SWIFT could require its customers, mainly banks, to inform it of anyattacks - given that no bank could risk the threat of exclusion from the network, saidLieven Lambrecht, the head of human resources at SWIFT for a year-and-a-half throughMay 2015.But such a rule would require the agreement of its board, which is mainly made up ofsenior executives from the back ofﬁce divisions of the largest western banks, who wouldbe unlikely to approve such a policy, Lambrecht said.FIGHT OVER LIABILITYThis week, Vietnam's Tien Phong Bank said its SWIFT account, too, was used in anattempted hack last year. That effort failed, but it is another sign that cyber-criminalsare increasingly targeting the messaging network.In the Ecuadorean case, Wells Fargo denies any liability for the fraudulent transfers fromBDA accounts. Wells Fargo said in court records that it did not verify the authenticity ofthe BDA transfer requests because they came through SWIFT, which Wells called\"among the most widely used and secure\" systems for money transfers.BDA is seeking recovery of the money, plus interest. Wells Fargo is attempting to havethe case thrown out.New York-based Citibank also transferred $1.8 million in response to fraudulentrequests made through BDA’s SWIFT terminal, according to the BDA lawsuit againstWells Fargo.Citibank repaid the $1.8 million to BDA, according to a BDA court ﬁling in April. Citibankdeclined to comment.For its part, Wells Fargo refunded to BDA $958,700 out of the $1,486,230 it transferredto an account in the name of a Jose Mariano Castillo at Wells Fargo in Los Angeles,according to the lawsuit. Reuters could not locate Castillo or verify his existence.ANATOMY OF A CYBER HEIST01/04/24, 21:00Special Report - Cyber thieves exploit banks' faith in SWIFT transfer network | Reuters Pagina 6 di 10https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-heist-swift-specialreport-idUSKCN0YB0DD/Powering SustainableBusinessSponsored by EPSON The BDA-Wells Fargo case is unusual in that one bank took its correspondent bank tocourt, thus making the details public, said Scanio, the Washington attorney.BDA acknowledged in a January court ﬁling that it took more than a week after the ﬁrstfraudulent transfer request for BDA to discover the missing money.After obtaining a BDA employee’s SWIFT logon, the thieves then ﬁshed out previouslycancelled or rejected payment requests that remained in BDA’s SWIFT outbox.They then altered the amounts and destinations on the transfer requests and reissuedthem, both banks said in ﬁlings.While Wells Fargo has claimed in court ﬁlings that failures of security at BDA are toblame for the breach, BDA has alleged that Wells could easily have spotted and rejectedthe unusual transfers. BDA noted that the payment requests were made outside of itsnormal business hours and involved unusually large amounts.The BDA theft and others underscore the need for banks on both sides of suchtransactions – often for massive sums – to rely less on SWIFT for security andstrengthen their own veriﬁcation protocols, Cumberland said.“This image of the SWIFT network and the surrounding ecosystem being secure andimpenetrable has encouraged complacency,” he said.Additional reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston and Alexandra Valencia in Quito; Editing by DavidGreising and Brian ThevenotOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Purchase Licensing RightsPurchase Licensing RightsPurchase Licensing RightsPurchase Licensing RightsRead Next Middle EastIran says Israel bombedits embassy in Syria,killing a topcommanderIran's consulate in the Syriancapital Damascus was ﬂattenedon Monday in what Syrian andWorldExclusive: Iran alertedRussia to security threatbefore Moscow attackIran tipped off Russia about thepossibility of a major \"terroristoperation\" on its soil ahead ofthe concert hall massacre nearMoscow last month, threeMiddle EastErdogan vows to makeamends after humblingelection loss in TurkeyPresident Tayyip Erdoganvowed on Monday to correctany mistakes that led to hisparty's defeat in Turkey's localelections where the opposition01/04/24, 21:00Special Report - Cyber thieves exploit banks' faith in SWIFT transfer network | Reuters Pagina 7 di 10https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-heist-swift-specialreport-idUSKCN0YB0DD/ Active ETFs vs. Mutual Funds:What's the Difference?
