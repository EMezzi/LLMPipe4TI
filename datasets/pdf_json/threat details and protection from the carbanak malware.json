This highlights a kind of threat that the banking industry faces differ, one that might not directly affect the end-users as with the case with phishing and online banking malware, but is equally or just as critical. Banks are networks that hold very critical financial data, which makes them perfect targets for cyber attacks. According to reports, the attackers were able to infiltrate 100 banks located in various countries, including Russia, USA, Germany, China, and Ukraine. Here are the high-level details on how the infiltration was executed: Spear phishing emails  were sent to the banks’ employees, containing either an exploit  (CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2013- 3906, CVE- 2014-1761) or a malicious CPL file . Both the exploit and the malicious CPL file drop the Carbanak malware into the system. Carbanak is a backdoor designed to execute various commands  including logging keystrokes, taking screenshots, and checking for specific banking applications such as fund transfer software.  The attackers used Carbanak to  move laterally within the network  through remote administration tools to reach target systems, which are those that involve processing bank accounts. Once target systems are reached, the attackers record videos of the affected user’s operation to be familiar with the victim’s workflow. The attackers then used this information and access to manipulate bank records and transfer funds into their accounts without being detected.  This attack is notable for its usage of techniques that aimed to mimic normal activities within the network in order to evade detection. It raises the importance of having a security strategy that is designed to see through these techniques and detect malicious activities. DETAILS Custom Defense Solutions Trend Micro Custom Defense employs a comprehensive 360-degree detection to minimize the opportunities for a targeted attack through its family of security solutions. Trend Micro Deep Discovery  provides the network-wide visibility and intelligence that is the cornerstone of the Custom Defense solution against so-called APTs (advanced persistent threats) and targeted attacks such as this one. For the Carbanak attack scenario, Deep Discovery could detect the attack at several different points in the sequence of events: Trend Micro Deep Discovery Email Inspector  is able to detect the spear-phishing emails sent by attackers to the banks’ employees as the initial step to breach traditional security defenses, establish a foothold, and commence a targeted attack. Deep Discovery Email Inspector has email inspection capabilities that discover malicious content, attachments, and URL links that pass unnoticed through standard email secu Trend Micro Deep Discovery Analyzer  is able to detect even previously unknown threats by analyzing a broad range of file types, sizes, and sources using customizable sandbox environments that attackers design and build to match organization’s desktop and device platforms. It enhances the malware detection capabilities of all existing security investments by giving the ability to share detected and analyzed threat insight, enabling security infrastructure to prevent malicious communication, websites, applications, malware and attacker behavior from spreading.   Trend Micro Deep Discovery Inspector  is able to identify suspicious activities anywhere on   network, such as those executed by Carbanak in moving laterally through the network and connecting to its command and control. Deep Discovery Inspector is also able to proactively detect the traffic triggered by the remote administration tool used by attackers: Deep Discovery Inspector is capable of monitoring traffic across all ports and more than 80 protocols and applications to detect threats that are purposely built to evade traditional security defenses. It also features Trend Micro Advanced Threat Scan Engine that is able to detect the malicious email attachments with embedded exploit code through its forward-looking heuristic rules. Once detected, Deep Discovery can provide the organization with both local intelligence and global threat intelligence from the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network to identify and assess the risk of the malware, communications or activities found.  Finally, Deep Discovery provides automated security signature updates and alert notifications to the organizations’s other security products to enable a full Custom Defense that stops the attack from progressing further. Examples include:  Providing IOC (Indicators of Compromise) information including C&C blacklists to both Trend Micro and third party security products  SIEM alerting and full IOC sharing Optionally invoking Trend Micro Network VirusWall Enforcer to isolate endpoints known to be infected Endpoint Protection Properly-configured endpoint solutions can ensure the prevention of Carbanak from coming into the machine or network. Components of OfficeScan Corporate Edition (OSCE) such as SmartScan , Web Reputation Service , Behavior Monitoring , and Smart Feedback offer the best protection against Carbanak by detecting the malicious files.Rating: 1 found this helpful Category: Remove a Malware / Virus Solution Id: 1107858 Business  SupportHome & Home Office Support Business Support Partner Portal TrendMicro.com Product Logins Europe Sign in to My Support Threat Help & Research Renewals & Registration Contact Support Technical Support   Enter your search term    Worry-Free Business Security/Services (WFBS/WFBS-SVC)  is also equipped with technologies to detect and remove Carbanak in the machine or network  Mail Scanning Solution Email played a big part in the delivery of Carbanak, making it an important vector to protect from attackers.
