This blog links this recent ac\"vity with previous isolated publicrepor\"ng on similar a!acks we believe are related. We refer to these a!acks as MuddyWater due to the confusionin a!ribu\"ng these a!acks. Although the ac\"vity was previously linked by others to the FIN7 threat actor group,our research suggests the ac\"vity is in fact espionage related and unlikely to be FIN7 related.The MuddyWater a!acks are primarily against Middle Eastern na\"ons. However, we have also observed a!acksagainst surrounding na\"ons and beyond, including targets in India and the USA. MuddyWater a!acks arecharacterized by the use of a slowly evolving PowerShell-based ﬁrst stage backdoor we call “POWERSTATS”.Despite broad scru\"ny and reports on MuddyWater a!acks, the ac\"vity con\"nues with only incremental changesto the tools and techniques.Introduc\"on & OverviewThe Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 research team recently came across a series of malicious ﬁles which were almostiden\"cal to those targe\"ng the Saudi Arabian government previously discussed by MalwareBytes. Which in turn,closely resembles a previous ar\"cle by Morphisec. These a!acks have also been tracked by several otherresearchers on Twi!er and elsewhere.The ac\"vity has been consistent throughout 2017 and, based on our analysis, targets or is suspected to target,en\"\"es in the following countries:By Tom LancasterNovember 14, 2017 at 1:00 PMCategory: Unit 42Tags: FIN7, Lazagne, Meterpreter, Mimikatz, MuddyWaterSHARE  Under Attack?About Unit 42ServicesUnit 42 Threat ResearchPartnersResources01/04/24, 21:22Muddying the Water: Targeted Attacks in the Middle East Pagina 2 di 12https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-muddying-the-water-targeted-attacks-in-the-middle-east/Saudi ArabiaIraqIsraelUnited Arab EmiratesGeorgiaIndiaPakistanTurkeyUSAThe malicious documents were adjusted according to the target regions, o#en using the logos of branches of localgovernment, promp\"ng the users to bypass security controls and enable macros.

In some of their recent a!ack documents, the a!ackersalso used GitHub as a hos\"ng site for their custom backdoor, POWERSTATS. Speciﬁcally, the following GitHubrepositories appear to be controlled by the MuddyWater threat actor(s):[unknown SHA256]Downloads payload from:hxxps:/ /raw.githubusercontent[.]com/F0R3X/BrowserFontArabic/master/ArabicBrowserFont.exe[unknown SHA256]Downloads payload from:hxxps:/ /raw.githubusercontent[.]com/F0R3X/BrowserFontArabic/master/FontArabic.exe9b5e36bb7518a9e333c31d09b589102f89e3425571dd434820ab3c437dc4e0d9 (and several others)Downloads payload from:hxxps:/ /raw.githubusercontent[.]com/ReactDeveloper2017/react/master/src/test/test.jsInteres\"ngly, both proﬁles were populated with forked repositories to give them an air of legi\"macy as shown inﬁgure 2. The POWERSTATS malware was compiled as an exe using PS2EXE. However, this was a minor anomaly,as it was only seen in this case: raw scripts being used in all other cases.

In one case, the a!ackers sent a malicious document which was nearly iden\"cal to alegi\"mate a!achment which we observed later being sent to the same recipient. This indicates that the a!ackersstole and modiﬁed a legi\"mate document from the compromised user account, cra#ed a malicious decoy Wordmacro document using this stolen document and sent it to the target recipient who might be expec\"ng the emailfrom the original account user before the real sender had \"me to send it.01/04/24, 21:22Muddying the Water: Targeted Attacks in the Middle East Pagina 6 di 12https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-muddying-the-water-targeted-attacks-in-the-middle-east/This targe\"ng of third party organiza\"ons to a!ack further targets is a risky move on the a!ackers’ part, as itpoten\"ally reveals their ac\"vity within the compromised third party organiza\"ons to the new target (thosereceiving the malicious documentsMaking sense of MuddyWaterWhen we looked at the cluster of ac\"vity which consisted of what appeared to be espionage-focused a!acks inthe Middle East, we were somewhat confused as the previous public repor\"ng had a!ributed these a!acks toFIN7. FIN7 is a threat actor group that is ﬁnancially mo\"vated with targets in the restaurant, services and ﬁnancialsectors. Following the trail of exis\"ng public repor\"ng, the \"e to FIN7 is essen\"ally made based on a downloadobserved from a MuddyWater C2, of a non-public tool “DNSMessenger”.For example, Morphisec wrote:“Later in our investigation, the same command server also delivered a variant ofthe DNS messenger similar to that described by Talos. The domain names differed butthe script adheres to the same logic (including the logic function).”The DNSMessenger malware is an obfuscated and customized version of the popular DNS_TXT_PWNAGE.ps1script available on GitHub and is also referred to by FireEye as POWERSOURCE. The use of the DNSMessengertool appears primarily linked to FIN7, with no other samples being a!ributable to MuddyWater.This led us to query the rela\"onship between the newer a!acks we were looking at and the alleged FIN7 link. Aspart of this research, we came up with the following hypotheses along with their likelihoods, and a ra\"onale foreach one.1) The FIN7 threat actor is also involved in espionage in the Middle East - UnlikelyWhilst this may seem an a!rac\"ve hypothesis to some, there are aspects on the technical side that simply don’tadd up. Primarily, there are signiﬁcant dispari\"es between FIN7 and MuddyWater, speciﬁcally in terms of:Malware unique to FIN7, or commonly used by them has not yet been seen in any MuddyWater inves\"ga\"ons(except for the single observa\"on of the DNSMessenger sample)Other non-public malware and tools used by MuddyWater have not been observed in our FIN7 inves\"ga\"ons.From an infrastructure point of view there is no overlap between the two sets of ac\"vity, the only overlap is theuse of the unique tool “DNSMessenger”When these points are considered together in conjunc\"on with the signiﬁcant diﬀerence in targe\"ng they make astrong case for classifying this ac\"vity as dis\"nct from FIN7 ac\"vity.2) The DNSMessenger malware is a shared tool, used by FIN7, MuddyWater and perhaps other groups - UnlikelyWe have a!empted to ﬁnd examples of code available in public data sources that would generate the varia\"on ofthe DNSMessenger malware and had li!le luck in doing so. Even though the code for DNSMessenger is publiclyavailable following research into a!ackers published by 3 par\"es, a!ackers would have to write thecorresponding server side to use it, and as such they may well choose to use the public DNS_TXT_Pwnage.ps1script instead.Despite this, based on the chain of analysis above we cannot discount the no\"on that DNSMessenger is shared bymul\"ple a!ackers, including FIN7 and MuddyWater.3) There was a mistake in the original Morphisec analysis which linked these a!acks to FIN7 -  PossibleLi!le detail is given on the nature of how the connec\"on between DNSMessenger and MuddyWater wasdiscovered it isn’t possible for us to verify this link.4) The a!ackers realized they were under inves\"ga\"on and planted a false ﬂag - PossibleThe a!ackers realized they were under inves\"ga\"on and planted a false ﬂag on their C2 server, uploading a copyof the FIN7 DNSMessenger code which had been previously men\"oned (and was since publicly available) byFireEye and delivering it to researchers to trick them into mis-a!ribu\"ng the campaign.Indeed, the sample shared by Morphisec on PasteBin is iden\"cal to the one dropped by the sample discussed inthe FireEye FIN7 SEC campaign blog except for the ﬁnal line.rd01/04/24, 21:22Muddying the Water: Targeted Attacks in the Middle East Pagina 7 di 12https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-muddying-the-water-targeted-attacks-in-the-middle-east/Final thoughtsWhilst we could conclude with conﬁdence that the a!acks discussed in this ar\"cle are not FIN7 related, we werenot able to answer many of our ques\"ons about the MuddyWater a!acks. We are currently unable to make a ﬁrmconclusion about the origin of the a!ackers, or the speciﬁc types of informa\"on they seek out once on a network.In any case we will con\"nue to track their ac\"vi\"es to provide protec\"ons for our customers.We hope the analysis presented shows the importance of drawing your own conclusions based on the dataavailable to you, not just taking the conclusions given in the public domain at face value. This is especially truewhen actors who rely on slightly modiﬁed (and publicly available) open source tools are in play. Copycat threatactors can easily mimic a!ackers who use open source tools which can confuse a!ribu\"on eﬀorts meaning morethan one aspect of the a!acks observed must be considered when clustering.On top of this, whilst the vast majority of threat analysis in the public domain is repeatable and correct, in somecases it can be diﬃcult to verify the analysis available. When it is hard to reproduce the analysis the conﬁdence inany conclusions drawn must be lower than it would otherwise be, since you cannot know for sure that what isstated is true.Palo Alto Networks
