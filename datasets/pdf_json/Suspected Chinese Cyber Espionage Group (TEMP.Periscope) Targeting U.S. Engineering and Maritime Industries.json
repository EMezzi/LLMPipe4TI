Thecampaign is linked to a group of suspected Chinese cyber espionage actors we have trackedsince 2013, dubbed TEMP.Periscope. The group has also been reported as “Leviathan” by othersecurity ﬁrms.The current campaign is a sharp escalation of detected activity since summer 2017. Likemultiple other Chinese cyber espionage actors, TEMP.Periscope has recently re-emerged andhas been observed conducting operations with a revised toolkit. Known targets of this grouphave been involved in the maritime industry, as well as engineering-focused entities, andinclude research institutes, academic organizations, and private ﬁrms in the United States.FireEye products have robust detection for the malware used in this campaign.TEMP.Periscope BackgroundActive since at least 2013, TEMP.Periscope has primarily focused on maritime-related targetsacross multiple verticals, including engineering ﬁrms, shipping and transportation,manufacturing, defense, government o\"ces, and research universities. However, the grouphas also targeted professional/consulting services, high-tech industry, healthcare, andmedia/publishing. Identiﬁed victims were mostly found in the United States, althoughorganizations in Europe and at least one in Hong Kong have also been affected.TEMP.Periscope overlaps in targeting, as well as tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs),with TEMP.Jumper, a group that also overlaps signiﬁcantly with public reporting on“NanHaiShu.”TTPs and Malware UsedIn their recent spike in activity, TEMP.Periscope has leveraged a relatively large library ofmalware shared with multiple other suspected Chinese groups. These tools include:AIRBREAK: a JavaScript-based backdoor also reported as “Orz” that retrieves commandsfrom hidden strings in compromised webpages and actor controlled proﬁles onlegitimate services.BADFLICK: a backdoor that is capable of modifying the ﬁle system, generating a reverseshell, and modifying its command and control (C2) conﬁguration.PHOTO: a DLL backdoor also reported publicly as “Derusbi”, capable of obtainingdirectory, ﬁle, and drive listing; creating a reverse shell; performing screen captures;recording video and audio; listing, terminating, and creating processes; enumerating,starting, and deleting registry keys and values; logging keystrokes, returning usernames mandiant.com uses cookies from Google to deliver andenhance the quality of its services and to analyze tra!c.

Some strings are obfuscated withXOR x56. The malware accepts up to two arguments at the command line: one to displaycleartext credentials for each login session, and a second to display cleartextcredentials, NTLM hashes, and malware version for each login session.LUNCHMONEY: an uploader that can exﬁltrate ﬁles to Dropbox.MURKYTOP: a command-line reconnaissance tool. It can be used to execute ﬁles as adifferent user, move, and delete ﬁles locally, schedule remote AT jobs, perform hostdiscovery on connected networks, scan for open ports on hosts in a connected network,and retrieve information about the OS, users, groups, and shares on remote hosts.China Chopper: a simple code injection webshell that executes Microsoft .NET codewithin HTTP POST commands. This allows the shell to upload and download ﬁles, executeapplications with web server account permissions, list directory contents, access ActiveDirectory, access databases, and any other action allowed by the .NET runtime.The following are tools that TEMP.Periscope has leveraged in past operations and could useagain, though these have not been seen in the current wave of activity:Beacon: a backdoor that is commercially available as part of the Cobalt Strike softwareplatform, commonly used for pen-testing network environments. The malware supportsseveral capabilities, such as injecting and executing arbitrary code, uploading anddownloading ﬁles, and executing shell commands.BLACKCOFFEE: a backdoor that obfuscates its communications as normal tra\"c tolegitimate websites such as Github and Microsoft's Technet portal. Used by APT17 andother Chinese cyber espionage operators.Additional identifying TTPs include:Spear phishing, including the use of probably compromised email accounts.Lure documents using CVE-2017-11882 to drop malware.Stolen code signing certiﬁcates used to sign malware.Use of bitsadmin.exe to download additional tools.01/04/24, 15:24Suspected Chinese Cyber Espionage Group (TEMP.Periscope) Targeting U.S. Engineering and Maritime Industries | Mandiant Pagina 4 di 8https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/suspected-chinese-espionage-group-targeting-maritime-and-engineering-industries Use of PowerShell to download additional tools.Using C:\\Windows\\Debug and C:\\Perﬂogs as staging directories.Leveraging Hyperhost VPS and Proton VPN exit nodes to access webshells on internet-facing systems.Using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for persistence.Using Windows Shortcut ﬁles (.lnk) in the Startup folder that invoke the WindowsScripting Host (wscript.exe) to execute a Jscript backdoor for persistence.Receiving C2 instructions from user proﬁles created by the adversary on legitimatewebsites/forums such as Github and Microsoft's TechNet portal.ImplicationsThe current wave of identiﬁed intrusions is consistent with TEMP.Periscope and likely reﬂectsa concerted effort to target sectors that may yield information that could provide an economicadvantage, research and development data, intellectual property, or an edge in commercialnegotiations.As we continue to investigate this activity, we may identify additional data leading to greateranalytical conﬁdence linking the operation to TEMP.Periscope or other known threat actors, aswell as previously unknown campaigns.IndicatorsFileHashDescriptionx.js3fefa55daeb167931975c22df3eca20aHOMEFRY, a 64-bit Windows passworddumper/crackermt.exe40528e368d323db0ac5c3f5e1efe4889MURKYTOP, a command-line reconnaissance tool com4.jsa68bf5fce22e7f1d6f999b7a580ae477AIRBREAK, a JavaScript-based backdoor whichretrieves commands from hidden strings incompromised webpagesHistorical IndicatorsFileHashDescription01/04/24, 15:24Suspected Chinese Cyber Espionage Group (TEMP.Periscope) Targeting U.S. Engineering and Maritime Industries | Mandiant Pagina 5 di 8https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/suspected-chinese-espionage-group-targeting-maritime-and-engineering-industries green.ddd3eb6f85ac046a96204096ab65bbd3e7eAIRBREAK, aJavaScript-basedbackdoorwhichretrievescommandsfrom hiddenstrings incompromisedwebpagesBG#6e843ef4856336fe3ef4ed27a4c792b1Beacon, acommerciallyavailablebackdoormsresamn.ttfa9e7539c1ebe857bae6efceefaa9dd16PHOTO, alsoreported asDerusbi1024-aa6a121f98330df2edee6c4391df21ff43a33604bd9e4c82bf12c4e7a58221fc52fed705BADFLICK,backdoorthat iscapable ofmodifying theﬁle system,generating areverse shell,andmodifying itscommand-and-controlconﬁgurationLink to RSS feedPrepare for2024'scybersecurity01/04/24, 15:24Suspected Chinese Cyber Espionage Group (TEMP.Periscope) Targeting U.S. Engineering and Maritime Industries | Mandiant Pagina 6 di 8https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/suspected-chinese-espionage-group-targeting-maritime-and-engineering-industrieslandscape.
