Learn More.The National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC) website was allegedly infiltrated by Chinese nation-state threat actors,according to a new report from Fidelis Cybersecurity. The attack against the NFTC site has been dubbed ‘OperationTradeSecret’ by Fidelis and is seen as an attempt to gain insight into individuals closely associated with U.S tradepolicy activities.Fidelis is attributing the Operation TradeSecret attack to a group that is also known in the security researchcommunity as APT10 and Stone Panda. The same attack group has also been recently actively attacking government sites in the U.K and Japan in an attackthat PWC UK and BAE Systems refers to as, Operation CloudHopper.With Operation TradeSecret, the attackers were able to infiltrate the NFTC site and embed malware on several registration pages. The malware used isidentified by Fidelis as being the Scanbox reconnaissance framework. The Scanbox malware is used by attackers to gain insight into victim’s activities andinformation. According to Fidelis, the attack ran from February 27 to March 1 of this year. John Bambenek, Threat Systems Manager at Fidelis said that hiscompany has informed the NFTC of the incident.“At a high-level, this method of attack is common and has been seen against the defense industrial base and telecoms by APT10 for many years,” Bambenektold eWEEK.From a detection perspective, Bambenek explained that Fidelis’ security tools are informed by the company’s threat intelligence team, a portion of which isdedicated to nation-state adversaries.  “Those tools derive an immense amount of metadata about every session, so that we can find distinct fingerprints that point to a specific actor,” Bambeneksaid. “We are also able to apply intelligence retroactively, so as we discover new threats we can look backwards weeks and months to see if attacks have beensuccessful in the past.”From an attribution perspective for the new Operation TradeSecret campaign, there are a number of attributes that clearly point the finger at Chinese nation-state attackers. Bambenek commented that Scanbox is a tool exclusively seen previously being used by Chinese nation-state sponsored actors.  “The specific obfuscation and other techniques in this instance have been used in the past only by APT10,” Bambenek said. “It is possible that another actorsomehow got their hands on these tools and are mimicking the techniques, but it is not likely.”At this point, it’s not entirely clear how the Operation TradeSecret attackers were actually able to infiltrate the NFTC site and embed the Scanbox malware.Bambenek commented that Fidelis can only speculate as to how this happened to their website. That said he noted that in general terms, there are a number ofdifferent things organizations can use to help defend themselves. Bambenek recommends that organizations use a strong web-application firewall (WAF) to prevent against attacks on their webserver and database layer andhave integrity monitoring on webpages to detect unauthorized changes. Additionally, he suggests that organizations work with their peers in the industry toshare threat data, so that soft targets around government can collaboratively protect themselves against foreign intelligence services.Sean Michael KernerSean Michael Kerner is an Internet consultant, strategist, and contributor to several leading IT business web sites.By Sean Michael Kerner -April 6, 2017 01/04/24, 21:11Chinese Nation-State Hackers Target U.S in Operation TradeSecret, Report Claims Pagina 2 di 2https://www.eweek.com/security/chinese-nation-state-hackers-target-u.s-in-operation-tradesecret/Get the Free Newsletter!Subscribe to Daily Tech Insider for top news, trends & analysisWork Email AddressBy signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.SubscribeGet the Free Newsletter!Subscribe to Daily Tech Insider for top news,trends & analysisWork Email AddressBy signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to ourTerms of Use and Privacy Policy.Subscribe×Privacy"
