[1] The email me ssages containe d malicio us documents with a mal ware payloa d called LOWBaLL. LOWBaLL ab uses the Dropbox clo ud storage service for comman d and control (CnC). We collabo rated with Dropbox to inve stigate the th reat, and our cooperation revealed what may be a second, similar operation. The attack i s part of a trend where threat groups hide malicio us activity by comm unicating with legitimate web services such as social net working and cloud storage sites to foil detection effo rts.[2][3] a Cybe r Campaign Likely Intended to Monito r Hong Kong Media During a Pe riod of Crisis The threat group has previously used newsworthy event s as lures to deliver malware.[4] They have la rgely targeted organizations involve d in financial, economic an d trade policy, typically using publicly available RaT s such as Poison Ivy, as well some non-p ublic back doors.[5] The group started targeting Hong Kong me dia companie s, probably in response to political an d economic challenge s in Hong Kong an d China. The th reat group’s latest activity coinci ded with the anno uncement of criminal cha rges against democracy activi sts.[6] During the pa st 12 month s, Chinese authorities have face d several challenge s, including large-scale protests in Hong Kong in late 2014, the p recipitous decline in the stock market in mi d-2015 , and the ma ssive industrial explo sion in Tianjin in a ugust 2015 . In Hong Kong, the p ro- democracy movement pe rsists, and the gove rnment recently denied a professor a post because of his links to a pro-democracy leader.[7] Multiple China-ba sed cyber threat groups have ta rgeted international me dia organizations in the pa st. The targeting ha s often foc used on Hong Kong-ba sed media, particularly those that p ublish pro-democracy mate rial. The me dia organizations targeted with the th reat group’s well-crafted Chinese language lure documents are precisely those whose networks Beijing would seek to monito r. Cyber threat groups’ access to the me dia organization’s networks could potentially p rovide the gove rnment a dvance warning on upcoming p rotests, information on p ro-democracy group leaders, and insights needed to disrupt activity on the Internet, such as what occ urred in mid-2014 when several websites were brought down in denial of service attack s.[8] Threat acto rs Use Spear Phishing W ritten in T raditional Chine se Script in attempte d Intrusions In august 2015 , the th reat acto rs sent spear phishing email s to a number of Hong Kong-ba sed media organizations, including newspapers, radio, and television. The fi rst email references the creation of a Ch ristian civil society o rganization to coinci de with the annive rsary of the 2014 protests in Hong Kong kno wn as the Umbrella Movement. The second email references a Hong Kong Unive rsity alumni organization that fea rs votes in a referendum to appoint a Vice-Chancello r will be co-opte d by pro-Beijing inte rests.[9] Figure 1: Lure Screenshots The group’s previous activitie s against financial an d policy o rganizations have la rgely foc used on spear phishing emails written in English, destined for Western audiences. This campaign, ho wever, is clearly designed for those who read the traditional Chine se script commonly used in Hong Kong. LOWBaLL Mal ware analy sis The spear phishing email s containe d three attachment s in total, each of which exploite d an older vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CV E-2012 -0158 ): MD5 Filename b9208 a5b0504cb2283 b1144fc455eaaa 使命公民運動  我們的異象 .doc ec19ed7cddf9298 4906325d a59f75351 新聞稿及公佈 .doc 6495b384748188188d09 e9d5a0c401a4(代發)[采訪通知 ]港大校友關注組遞 信行動 .doc In all three cases, the payloa d was the same: MD5 Filename d76261 ba3b624933a6ebb5dd73758db4 time.exe This backdoor, known as LOWBaLL, uses the legitimate D ropbox clo ud-storage service to act a s the CnC server.

However, this is most likely meant to be a mechani sm to update the comp romised host with a ne w version of the LOWBaLL mal ware. The threat group monito rs its Dropbox acco unt for responses from comp romised computers. Once the LOWBaLL mal ware calls back to the D ropbox acco unt, the attacke rs will create a file calle d “[COMPUT ER_naME]_upload.bat” which contain s comman ds to be exec uted on the comp romised computer. This batch file i s then exec uted on the ta rget comp uter, with the results uploaded to the attacke rs’ Dropbox account in a file name d “[COMPUT ER_naME]_download”. We observed the threat group issue the follo wing comman ds: @echo off   dir c:\\ >> %temp%\\ download   ipconfig /all >> %temp%\\ download   net user >> %temp%\\ download   net user /domain >> %temp%\\ download   ver >> %temp%\\ download   del %0   @echo off   dir \"c:\\Doc uments and Setting s\" >> %temp%\\ download   dir \"c:\\Program File s\\   \" >> %temp%\\ download   net start >> %temp%\\ download   net localg roup administrator >> %temp%\\ download   netstat -ano >> %temp%\\ download These comman ds allow the threat group to gain info rmation abo ut the comp romised computer and the net work to which it belong s. Using this information, they can decide to explo re further or instruct the comp romised computer to download additional mal ware. We observed the threat group upload a second stage mal ware, known as BUBBL EWRaP (al so known as Backdoor.aPT.FakeWin HTTPHelper) to thei r Dropbox acco unt along with the follo wing comman d: @echo off   ren \"%temp%\\ upload\" audiodg.exe   start %temp%\\a udiodg.exe   dir d:\\ >> %temp%\\ download   systeminfo >> %temp%\\ download   del %0   We have p reviously observed the admin@338  group use BUBBL EWRaP. Thi s particular sample connecte d to the CnC domain acco unts.serveftp[.]com, which resolved to an IP address previously used by the th reat group, although the IP had not been used for some time p rior to this most recent activity: MD5    0beb957923d f2c885d29 a9c1743dd9 4b accounts.serveftp.com 59.188.0.197 BUBBL EWRaP i s a full-featured backdoor that is set to run when the system boot s, and can comm unicate using HTTP, HTTPS, o r a SOCKS p roxy. Thi s backdoor collects system info rmation, incl uding the ope rating system version and hostname, an d includes functionality to check, upload, and register plugins that can f urther enhance its capabilitie s. a Secon d Operation FireEye works closely with security researchers and industry partners to mitigate cybe r threats, and we collabo rated with Dropbox to respond to this activity. The D ropbox security team was able to i dentify thi s abuse and put countermeasures in place. Our cooperation uncovered what appea rs to be a second, ongoing ope ration, tho ugh we lack sufficient evidence to ve rify if admin@338  is behind it. The attack lifecycle follo wed the same patte rn, though some of the filename s were different, which indicates that the re may be m ultiple ve rsions of the mal ware. In addition, while the ope ration ta rgeting Hong Kong-ba sed media involve d a smaller number of targets and a limite d duration, we suspect thi s second operation involve s up to 50 targets. at this time, we are unable to i dentify the victim s. In this case, after the payloa d is delivered via an exploit the th reat acto r places files (named upload.bat, upload.rar, and period.txt, download.txt or silent.txt) in a directory on a D ropbox acco unt. The mal ware beacon s to this directory using the ha rdcoded aPI token an d attempt s to download these files (which are deleted from the D ropbox acco unt after the download): upload.bat, a batch script that the comp romised machine will execute upload.rar, a RaR a rchive that contain s at least two files: a batch script to exec ute, and often an exec utable (sometime s named rar.exe)  which the batch script will run and almost always uploads the results of download.rar to the clo ud storage acco unt silent.txt an d period.txt,  small file s sizes of 0-4 byte s that dictate the f requency to check in with the CnC The threat acto r will then download the results and then delete the file s from the clo ud storage acco unt. Conclusion LOWBaLL i s an example of mal ware that ab uses cloud storage services to mask its activity f rom net work defenders. The LOWBaLL fi rst stage mal ware allows the group to collect info rmation f rom victim s and then deliver the BUBBL EWRaP second stage mal ware to thei r victims after verifying that they a re indeed interesting targets. a version of thi s article appea red first on the FireEye Intelligence Cente r.
