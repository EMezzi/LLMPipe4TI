However, thegroup behind MuddyWater has been known to targetother countries in the Middle East, Europe and the US. Werecently noticed a large amount of spear phishingdocuments that appear to be targeting governmentbodies, military entities, telcos and educational institutionsin Jordan, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Pakistan, in addition tothe continuous targeting of Iraq and Saudi Arabia, othervictims were also detected in Mali, Austria, Russia, Iran andBahrain.. These new documents have appearedthroughout 2018 and escalated from May onwards. Theattacks are still ongoing.//AUTHORSTable of ContentsSummaryDecoy images by countryJordanTurkeySaudi ArabiaAzerbaijanIraqPakistanAfghanistanT echnical detailsThe initial infection vectorThe macro payload analysis, dropped!les and registry keysCase 1: INF, SCT and text !les droppedby the macroCase 2: VBS and text !les dropped bythe macroThe PowerShell codeCnC communicationVictim system reconnaissance Content menuSearch...

The executables have been chosen speci!callyfor bypassing allowlisting solutions since they are all fromMicrosoft and very likely allowlisted. Regardless of the !leextensions, the !les dropped by the macro are EITHER INF,SCT and text !les OR VBS and text !les.Drops two or three !les into the “ProgramData” folder.The dropped !les are either in the root of the“ProgramData” folder or in a subdirectory. The !lenames may vary from one version of the malware toanother.1 Adds a registry entry in the current user’s RUN key(HKCU) for later execution when the user next logs in. Insome cases, the macro spawns the maliciouspayload/process instantly without waiting for the nexttime the user logs in.

The malicious decoy documents used inthe attacks suggest they are geopolitically motivated,targeting sensitive personnel and organizations.Attacker deception andattributionThe deobfuscated PowerShell code used by theMuddyWater group resembles previously seen PowerShellscripts that most likely served as prototypes. Multipledocuments used in the attacks also contain embeddedpaths from their authors’ machines. These paths areembedded by O\"ice under various circumstances, forinstance, when somebody adds a binary object (an OLEcontrol, e.g. text box or command button) into a Worddocument.
