Summary informationThe Gaza cybergang is an Arabic-language, politically-motivated cybercriminal group, operating since 2012 andactively targeting the MENA (Middle East North Africa)region. The Gaza cybergang’s attacks have never sloweddown and its typical targets include governmententities/embassies, oil and gas, media/press, activists,politicians, and diplomats.One of the interesting new facts, uncovered in mid-2017, isits discovery inside an oil and gas organization in the MENA//AUTHORSGREAT WEBINARS13 MA Y 2021, 1:00PMGReAT Ideas.

Contact: 2. T echnical detailsPreviously, Gaza cybergang attacks were surprisinglysuccessful in using simple and common tools to achievetheir goals. They relied on a variety of Remote AccessTrojans (RATs) to perform their activities, includingDowneks, Qasar, Cobaltstrike…As recently as June 2017, however, the attackers startedusing the CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability which enables directcode execution from a Microsoft o\"ice document on non-patched victim systems (Cobaltstrike payload in this case).Another !nding is a possible Android Trojan that theattackers positioned on one of their command servers inApril 2017.In most cases, malware is sent by email as a compressedattachment or download links. Starting from March 2017,we have observed downloaders or Microsoft o\"icedocuments with embedded macros being sent to victims.When opened, the downloader would contact a URL or IPaddress to retrieve the actual payload. Once successfullyexecuted, the malware grants full access to the attackers,providing them with the ability to collect !les, keystrokesand screenshots from victims’ devices. If the initialdownloaded malware was detected by the victim, thedownloader would attempt to retrieve other malware !lesto the victim’s device, in the hope that one of those !leswould work.The full list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) can befound in Appendix I.

This is now achievedmore e\"iciently using the CVE 2017-0199 vulnerabilitywhich enables direct code execution abilities from aMicrosoft o\"ice document on non-patched victimWindows systems. The use of Microsoft Access database!les has also enabled the attackers to maintain low levelsof detection, as it’s not an uncommon method to delivermalware.These developments have helped the attackers continuetheir operations, targeting a variety of victims andorganizations, sometimes even bypassing defences andpersisting for prolonged periods.4.1. The extended use of humanitarian andpolitical causes in social engineeringattacksAttackers have continuously targeted victims andorganizations in government entities/embassies, oil andgas, media/press, activists, politicians, and diplomats.The Gaza cybergang relies increasingly on advanced andup-to-date social engineering techniques with politicaland humanitarian aspects that directly re#ect regionalincidents.
