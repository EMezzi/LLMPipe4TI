The update addresses a zero-day vulnerability  (CVE-2017-11292) that researchers found actively exploited by a group of threat actors known as BlackOasis.  According to researchers, BlackOasis exploits CVE-2017- 11292 to distribute the information-stealing malware FinSpy, a lso known as FinFisher (detected by Trend Micro as BKDR_FINSPY.A, TROJ_FRS.0NA003JC17, and WORM.Win32.TRX.XXPE002FF019). Last September, the group used a separate remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability ( CVE-2017-8759 ) to deliver a variant of the spyware, which is reportedly  being sold by its developers and operators as a suite of surveillance software. Researchers note that the attacks they’ve observed in the wild are targeting Windows machines.  BlackOasis’s attack involves the use of spear-phishing  emails sent to targets of interest. These malicious emails are attached with a Flash exploit within an ActiveX object embedded in a Word document. The infection chain is multi-stage, using several scripts to retrieve, decrypt, and execute the payload.  CVE-2017-11292  is a memory corruption flaw that can let an attacker execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system when successfully exploited. Attackers can lure victims with specially crafted Flash content. While it’s currently reported to be used in targeted attacks, its public disclosure is likely to make others employ it for their own cybercriminal activities. In fact, some of the other vulnerabilities that BlackOasis use in their campaigns have been employed by other cyberespionage and cybercriminal groups: BlackOasis uses sociopolitical themes as social engineering lures. Like other cyberespionage groups such as BlackTech, ChessMaster , and Pawn Storm , BlackOasis employs decoy documents to divert the would-be victim’s attention away from their ulterior motive: steal confidential, mission-critical information. The researchers that monitored BlackOasis note that it is currently targeting Middle Eastern  politicians and United Nations officers, as well as journalists and activists. BlackOassis’s activities and FinSpy were also observed in Russia, the U.K., Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, and African countries.  Indeed, vulnerabilities are the bread and butter for many targeted attacks, and patching plays a crucial role  in defending against them. In the first half of 2017, 382 new vulnerabilities  were reported and disclosed via Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative, 92 of which were from Adobe—a number that's markedly higher than that of the second half of 2016. Enterprises need to balance their need for maintaining the infrastructure that drives their organizational operations, and the significance of securing them. Defense in depth provides layers of protection against threats that take advantage of security gaps. Some of the best practices to defend against these types of threats include: Trend Micro Solutions Trend Micro   Deep Discovery   provides detection, in-depth analysis, and proactive response to today’s stealthy malware, and targeted attacks in real-time. It provides a comprehensive defense tailored to protect organizations against targeted attacks and advanced threats through specialized engines, custom sandboxing , and seamless correlation across the entire attack lifecycle, allowing it to detect threats like the above mentioned zero- day attacks even without any engine or pattern update. Trend Micro  Deep Security   and Vulnerability Protection  provide virtual patching  that protects endpoints from threats that abuses unpatched vulnerabilities.   Given how BlackOasis uses email as an entry point, organizations need to further secure the email gateway to mitigate threats delivered by BlackOasis.  Trend Micro   Hosted Email Security  is a no-maintenance cloud solution that delivers continuously updated protection to stop spam, malware, spear phishing, ransomware, and advanced targeted attacks before they reach the network.  Trend Micro  Deep Discovery  Email Inspector  and InterScan  Web Security  prevent ransomware from ever reaching end users. At the endpoint level, Trend Micro  Smart Protection Suites , powered by XGen  security, deliver several capabilities like high-fidelity machine learning, behavior monitoring and application control, and vulnerability shielding that minimize the threat’s impact.
