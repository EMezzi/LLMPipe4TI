In addition to this, some of the tools used share code similarities with malware usedin historic attacks linked to a threat group known as Lazarus. The attacks can be traced back asfar as October 2015, two months prior to the discovery of the failed attack in Vietnam, whichwas hitherto the earliest known incident.The attack against the Bangladesh central bank triggered an alert by payments network SWIFT,after it was found the attackers had used malware to cover up evidence of fraudulent transfers.SWIFT issued a further warning, saying that it had found evidence of malware being usedagainst another bank in a similar fashion. Vietnam’s Tien Phong Bank subsequently stated that itintercepted a fraudulent transfer of over $1 million in the fourth quarter of last year. SWIFTconcluded that the second attack indicates that a “wider and highly adaptive campaign” isunderway targeting banks.A third bank, Banco del Austro in Ecuador, was also reported to have lost $12 million toattackers using fraudulent SWIFT transactions. However, no details are currently known aboutthe tools used in this incident or if there are any links to the attacks in Asia.Discovery of additional tools used by attackersSymantec has identiﬁed three pieces of malware which were being used in limited targetedattacks against the ﬁnancial industry in South-East Asia: Backdoor.Fimlis, Backdoor.Fimlis.B, andBackdoor.Contopee. At ﬁrst, it was unclear what the motivation behind these attacks were,however code sharing between Trojan.Banswift (used in the Bangladesh attack used tomanipulate SWIFT transactions) and early variants of Backdoor.Contopee provided aconnection.While analyzing samples of Trojan.Banswift, a distinct ﬁle wiping code was found. Some of thedistinctive properties of the wiping code include:Function takes two parameters: path of ﬁle to overwrite and number of iterations (maxsix)9914313455457334.32235.08329123.Z9352552325.8843BE58747578BANK35؀802397S2859436.813ध10352.2690 Favorited2 Views0 Files0 Shares0 Downloads01/04/24, 21:00Endpoint Protection - Symantec Enterprise Pagina 2 di 3https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/…Key=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocumentsIt will initially overwrite the last byte of the target ﬁle with 0x5FSix “control” bytes are supplied which dictate what bytes are used during the overwriteprocess  Figure 1. Unique wiping code found in Trojan.Banswift and additional Lazarus toolsAlready this code looked fairly unique. What was even more interesting was that when wesearched for additional malware containing the exact combination of “control” bytes, an earlyvariant of Backdoor.Contopee and the “msoutc.exe” sample already discussed in the recent BAEblog analyzing the Bangladesh attack were also found.Symantec believes distinctive code shared between families and the fact thatBackdoor.Contopee was being used in limited targeted attacks against ﬁnancial institutions inthe region, means these tools can be attributed to the same group.Historical attacksBackdoor.Contopee has been previously used by attackers associated with a broad threat groupknown as Lazarus. Lazarus has been linked to a string of aggressive attacks since 2009, largelyfocused on targets in the US and South Korea. The group was linked to Backdoor.Destover, ahighly destructive Trojan that was the subject of an FBI warning after it was used in an attackagainst Sony Pictures Entertainment. The FBI concluded that the North Korean government wasresponsible for this attack.01/04/24, 21:00Endpoint Protection - Symantec Enterprise Pagina 3 di 3https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/…Key=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocumentsThe group was the target of a cross-industry initiative known as Operation Blockbuster earlierthis year, which involved major security vendors sharing intelligence and resources in order toassist commercial and government organizations in protecting themselves against Lazarus. Aspart of the initiative, vendors are circulating malware signatures and other useful intelligencerelated to these attackers.Ongoing dangerThe discovery of more attacks provides further evidence that the group involved is conductinga wide campaign against ﬁnancial targets in the region. While awareness of the threat posed bythe group has now been raised, its initial success may prompt other attack groups to launchsimilar attacks. Banks and other ﬁnancial institutions should remain vigilant.ProtectionSymantec and Norton products protect against these threats with the following detections:AntivirusTrojan.BanswiftTrojan.Banswift!gen1Backdoor.ContopeeBackdoor.FimlisBackdoor.Fimlis.BTags and KeywordsRelated Entries and LinksNo Related Resource entered.
