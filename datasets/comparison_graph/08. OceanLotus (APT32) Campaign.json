  "text": "The Adobe_Flash_install.rar archive that was returned from the baomoivietnam.com website contained the files Flash_Adobe_Install.exe and goopdate.dll. The table below provides some basic information on all three of these files. The file goopdate.dll has the hidden file attribute set and will not show in Windows Explorer on systems using default settings. This results in the user seeing only the Flash_Adobe_Install.exe file to execute in order to install what they believe to be an update to Flash Player. When run, it will automatically load goopdate.dll due to search order hijacking. Goopdate.dll is a highly obfuscated loader whose ultimate purpose is to load a Cobalt Strike stager into memory and then execute it. The Cobalt Strike stager will simply try to download and execute a shellcode from a remote server, in this case using the following URL: summerevent.webhop.net/QuUA",
