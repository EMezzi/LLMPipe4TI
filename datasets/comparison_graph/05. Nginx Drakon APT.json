  "text": "The attacker first tried to attack from an outside host, using 98.23.182.25:80 to download Drakon APT and 108.192.100.31:80 for C2. That failed, though, so the attacker switched to ta1-pivot-2 for the attack C2. The malformed HTTP POST was sent from 128.55.12.167 and resulted in C2 to 128.55.12.233:80. The attacker then repeated the same attack against ta1-cadets-1, exfilâ€™ing /etc/password from both hosts. The connections were both left open for later. The CADETS hosts were both attacked in succession using the Nginx Drakon APT simulacrum. For the attack against CADETS the exploits Nginx by simulation of remote code execution on the listening port of the webserver TCP 80. A malicious HTTP post is sent to 128.55.12.75:80 and 128.55.12.51:80 respectively. The callback is established to C2 and the following commands are sent to gather intelligence on the host environment: hostname, whoami, cat /etc/passwd, whoami, and hostname. ",
