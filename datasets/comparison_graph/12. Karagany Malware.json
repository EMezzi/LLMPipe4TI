  "text": "In August and October 2016 we observed a malware operation targeting members of the Tibetan Parliament (the highest legislative organ of the Tibetan government in exile, formally known as Central Tibetan Administration). We collected two emails sent to Parliamentarians that rapidly repurposed legitimate content in an attempt to entice recipients to open malicious documents. The first attempt leveraged an old vulnerability in the parsing of Rich-text-format (.rtf) files (CVE-2012-0158). The second attempt used a newer, but also patched, .rtf vulnerability (CVE-2015-1641). Both attempts used versions of KeyBoy and shared the same command and control infrastructure as well as other configuration details. On August 25, 2016, members of the Tibetan Parliament received an email with information on an upcoming conference relevant to the Tibetan community. This email had the same subject and attachment as a legitimate message sent to the same recipients just 15 hours prior, but in this case the attachment was crafted to exploit a frequently targeted vulnerability in Microsoft Office. The accompanying malware was a backdoor implant designed to surveil the computers of the Parliamentarians. This malicious attachment used the original, legitimate filename as a decoy. This level of targeting and re-use of a legitimate document sent only hours before shows that the actors behind the operation are closely watching the Tibetan community, and may have already compromised the communications of one or more of the Parliamentarians.",
