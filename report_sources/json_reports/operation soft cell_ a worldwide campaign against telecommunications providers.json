The mot common credential tealing tool ued  the threat actor wa a\nmodi ed mimikatz  that dump NTLM hahe. Thi verion of mimikatz did not require an command line\nargument, mot likel in an attempt to avoid detection aed on command-line auditing.

The dumped peci c hive from the Window Regitr , uch a the AM hive, which\ncontain paword hahe.\nReg.exe i eing pawned from a hell proce.\nCommand-line argument indicate AM hive dumping.\nLATRAL MOVMNT\nOnce the threat actor mapped the network and otained credential (through net ue), the egan to move\nlaterall. The were ale to compromie critical aet including production erver and dataae\nerver, and the even managed to gain full control of the Domain Controller. The threat actor relied on WMI\nand Pxec to move laterall and intall their tool acro multiple aet.\nThe following example demontrate how the threat actor moved laterall from the  rt machine,\ncompromied  the modi ed verion of the China Chopper we hell , to other machine inide the\nnetwork.\n/c cd /d \"C:\\Program File\\Microoft\\xchange erver\\V15\\Frontnd\\HttpProx\\ecp\\auth\\\"&wmic\n/node:[RDACTD] /uer:\"[RDACTD]\" /paword:\"[RDACTD]\" proce call create a.at&echo\n[]&cd&echo []\nWMI command ued  the threat actor to move laterall.\nMAINTAINING A LONG-TRM FOOTHOLD AND TALING DATA\nThe threat actor aued the tolen credential to create rogue, high-privileged domain uer account\nwhich the then ued to take maliciou action.  creating thee account, the enured the would\nmaintain acce etween different wave of the attack. Once the threat actor regain their foothold, the\nalread have acce to a high-privileged domain uer account. Thi igni cantl reduce the “noie” of\nhaving to ue credential dumper repeatedl, which helped them evade detection.\nPOIONIVY\nA econd method the threat actor ued to maintain acce acro the compromied aet wa through the\ndeploment of the PoionIv RAT  (PIVY). Thi infamou RAT ha een aociated with man different\nChinee threat actor, including APT10, APT1, and DragonOK . It i a powerful, multi-featured RAT that let a\nthreat actor take total control over a machine.

To\naccomplih thi, it exploited a truted and igned application. The PIVY paload wa dropped along with\nthe truted and igned amung tool ( RunHelp.exe ) in the following manner:\n1. A nulloft intaller package  (NI) wa created with a legitimate, igned amung tool in it.\n2. Once executed, the intaller cript within the NI package extracted the amung tool and\nadded a fake DLL with the ame name a a legitimate DLL ( MUIDLL.dll) , which i required \nthe application.\n3. The DLL contain a PIVY tager, which i then loaded  the amung tool.\n4. After the fake DLL wa loaded  the amung tool, it decrpted a lo paload in the ame\nfolder, which contain the actual PIVY paload.\n5. It wa ale to achieve peritence  creating a rogue cheduled tak.\nPot-peritence execution of PIVY, ide-loaded into a legitimate amung application.\nPIVY’ ue of DLL ide-loading to aue amung tool i not new, and ha een reported previoul \nPalo Alto.

From thee we\nhell, the launched reconnaiance command, tole data, and dropped additional tool including\nportqr.exe , renamed cmd.exe, winrar, and the notoriou hTran.\nReconnaiance and lateral movement command launched from the econdar we hell.\nDATA XFILTRATION\nThe threat actor ex ltrated tolen data uing multiple different channel including we hell and hTran.\nCOMPRING TH TOLN DATA\nIn an attempt to hide the content of the tolen data, the threat actor ued winrar to compre and\npaword-protect it. The winrar inarie and compreed data were found motl in the Reccle in folder ,\na TTP that wa previoul oerved in APT10-related attack , a well a other.
