attacks \nbefore a patch is available to properly mitigate the risk.\n§For the purpose of this study, we focused on zero -days \nthat had been actively exploited in the wild for \nmalicious activity.Definitions©2019 FireEye\n©2019 FireEye9§FireEye original research\n§Google Project Zero -0day “in the wild” spreadsheet\n§Open source collectionsData Sources©2019 FireEye\n©2019 FireEye
