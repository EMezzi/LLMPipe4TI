In one of them, the group --\nwhich in cyber-security circles goes by many different names such\nas APT-C-06, Dubnium, Fallout Team, Karba, Luder, Nemim, SIG25,\nand Tapaoux-- also hid malware inside a copy of North Korea's\nantivirus  sent to foreign researchers for study.\nDARKHOTEL HACKERS HAD A FIXATION WITH\nINTERNET EXPLORER\nBut in 2018, the group has been especially active and has been\nseen numerous times targeting the same technology --Internet\nExplorer's VBScript scripting engine.\nThis year, researchers say DarkHotel hackers found and exploited a\nfirst IE zero-day  (CVE-2018-8174 ) in April, and then a second  (CVE-\n2018-8373 ) in August. Microsoft patched both, in May and\nSeptember, respectively.\nBut according to a new report  published today, researchers at Qihoo 360 Core say the group has\nalso created new exploits for two older IE scripting engine vulnerabilities --namely CVE-2017-11869\nand CVE-2016-0189 .\n\"After analysis, we found that the obfuscation and exploitation of these four [exploits] are highly\nconsistent,\" said Qihoo 360 Core researchers. \"We suspect that they are from the same hacker (or\nhacking group).\"\nZero-days are hard to discover and even harder to weaponize in usable exploits. Creating new\nexploits for old bugs isn't a walk in the part, either.\nWe may never know why DarkHotel is expending so many resources into targeting Internet\nExplorer, but the trend is quite visible for all APT researchers.\nIE'S VBSCRIPT ENGINE LIVING OUT ITS LAST DAYS\nInternet Explorer's VBScript scripting engine isn't your top notch Microsoft technology either. It's\nan ancient piece of code from the early days of Windows and Internet Explorer that has always\nbeen plagued by quite a large number of vulnerabilities.\nMicrosoft became well aware of this component's security flaws many years ago. That's why, in\nJuly 2017 , Microsoft announced that it was disabling the automatic execution of VBScript code in\nthe latest IE version that was included with the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, released in the\nfall of last year.\nThat change meant that hackers couldn't use VBScript code to attack users via Internet Explorer in\nWindows 10. Microsoft also promised patches to disable VBScript code execution in IE versions on\nolder Windows releases.\nThat change stopped many cybercrime operations, but DarkHotel seems to have adapted to\nMicrosoft's recent VBScript deprecation announcement.\nAccording to reports, DarkHotel apparently opted to use VBScript exploits embedded inside Office\ndocuments and did not target Internet Explorer users via the browser directly.\nInstead, DarkHotel sent Word documents to victims, documents in which they loaded a malicious\nweb page via embeddable IE frames. DarkHotel hackers chose wisely because, for these\ninstances, VBScript code execution was still permitted.\nBased on the current evidence, it appears that in 2018, the group has gone all-in on VBScript\nexploits before they become totally useless\nAs Microsoft continues to disable VBScript execution for more and more users, we might have\nwitnessed a cyber-espionage group emptying its VBScript arsenal in a desperate attempt to\nweaponize hacking tools before they become worthless in the coming years.\nNorth Korea's history of bold cyber attacks\nRELATED SECURITY COVERAGE:\nAdobe ColdFusion servers under attack from APT group\nCambodia's ISPs hit by some of the biggest DDoS attacks in the country's history\nUS Cyber Command starts uploading foreign APT malware to VirusTotal\nCisco updates ASR 9000 edge routing platform to carry users to 5G  TechRepublic\nMicrosoft working on porting Sysinternals to Linux\nHackers breach StatCounter to hijack Bitcoin transactions on Gate.io exchange\nWPA3 Wi-Fi is here, and it's harder to hack  CNET\nAhead of US midterms, Facebook removes 30 accounts and 85 Instagram profiles\nRELATED TOPICS:  SECURITY TV  DATA MANAGEMENT  CXO  DATA CENTERS\nBy Catalin Cimpanu  for Zero Day  | November 12, 2018 -- 19:29 GMT\n(19:29 GMT)  | Topic: Security\n SHOW COMMENTS\n1 -
