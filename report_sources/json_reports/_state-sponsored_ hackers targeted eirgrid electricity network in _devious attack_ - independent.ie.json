EirGrid moves wholesale power around the country. A breach of the system could result\nin power outages across the island.\nMalware has previously been used in the Ukraine by suspected Russian hackers to cause major\nnational power outages.\nThe Irish Independent has learned that the hack came to light after a tip-off from Vodafone and\nthe National Cyber Security centre in the UK to EirGrid.\nThe original breach took place on April 20 and lasted just short of seven hours.\nA source said that both Vodafone and the National Cyber Security Centre believed it was a\n\"state-sponsored attack\".\nThe breach of the Vodafone network allowed the hackers to create a type of wire tap known as\nGeneric Routing Encapsulation (GRE) to tunnel into EirGrid's Vodafone router located in\nShotton.\nHousehold customer information was not stored on the EirGrid computers but information\npertaining to commercial customers would have been transferred over the compromised\nnetwork.\nDavid Martin, spokesperson for EirGrid Group, said: \"We are aware of the currently reported\nfocus on energy companies and national infrastructure and wish to state that our computer\nsystems have not been breached.\"\nA spokesman for Vodafone said it did not comment on specific security incidents.\n\"In such cases we always work closely with the relevant authorities to investigate and take\nimmediate actions to contain the issue and protect our customers,\" he said.\nIrish Independent\nRelated Content\nNews\nExclusive: EirGrid targeted by 'state sponsored' hackers leaving networks exposed to\n'devious attack'\nIrish electricity transmission system operator EirGrid was targeted by “state sponsored” hackers\nleaving its network exposed to a “devious attack”.EirGrid was targeted by 'state sponsored' hackers.
