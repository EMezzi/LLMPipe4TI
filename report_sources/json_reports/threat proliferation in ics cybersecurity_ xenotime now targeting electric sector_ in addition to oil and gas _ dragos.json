    "text": "Threat Proliferation in ICS Cybersecurity:\nXENOTIME Now Targeting Electric Sector, in\nAddition to Oil and Gas\nJun 14, 2019  | Blog , Industry News\nBy Dragos, Inc\nThe most dangerous threat to ICS has new targets in its sights. Dragos identified the XENOTIME activity group expanded its\ntargeting beyond oil and gas to the electric utility sector. This expansion to a new vertical illustrates a trend that will likely continue\nfor other ICS-targeting adversaries.\nIndustrial control system (ICS) cyber threats are proliferating. More capable adversaries are investing heavily in the ability to disrupt\ncritical infrastructure like oil and gas, electric power, water, and more. Attacking any industrial sector requires significant resources,\nwhich increases as capabilities and targeting expand. The high resource requirement previously limited such attacks to a few\npotential adversaries, but as more players see value and interest in targeting critical infrastructure – and those already invested see\ndividends from their behaviors – the threat landscape grows.\nTo illustrate and highlight this major strategic risk to industrial environments worldwide and across every industry, Dragos is\npublishing new intelligence on XENOTIME. In anticipation of this release, Dragos worked with global electric utilities to increase their\ndefense against this and the other threats to industrial control systems. Dragos Platform customers have detections for XENOTIME,\nas the product receives these and other threat behavior detection updates regularly.\nXENOTIME Proliferation: A Shift in the ICS Threat Landscape\nXENOTIME , the group behind the TRISIS  event, previously focused on oil and gas related targeting . In February 2019, Dragos\nidentified a change in XENOTIME behavior: starting in late 2018, XENOTIME began probing the networks of electric utility\norganizations in the US and elsewhere using similar tactics to the group’s operations against oil and gas companies.\nMultiple ICS sectors now face the XENOTIME threat; this means individual verticals – such as oil and gas, manufacturing, or electric –\ncannot ignore threats to other ICS entities because they are not specifically targeted. As such, a key element in defense against\nsophisticated, expanding threats is understanding threat behaviors  and methodologies, beyond simply indicators of compromise.\nAsset owners and operators across ICS should be aware of XENOTIME’s tactics, techniques, and procedures, and consider using an\nICS-specific detection capability like the Dragos Platform while also implementing defensive recommendations discussed below.\nActivity Overview\nThe 2017 TRISIS malware attack on a Saudi Arabian oil and gas facility represented an escalation of attacks on ICS. TRISIS targeted\nsafety systems and was designed to cause loss of life or physical damage. Following that attack, XENOTIME expanded its operations\nto include oil and gas entities outside the Middle East. Additionally, the group compromised several ICS vendors and manufacturers\nin 2018, providing potential supply chain threat opportunities and vendor-enabled access to target ICS networks.\nXENOTIME operations since the TRISIS event in 2017 included significant external scanning, network enumeration, and open source\nresearch of potential victims, combined with attempts at external access. This activity emphasized North American  and European\ncompanies.\nIn February 2019, while working with clients across various utilities and regions, Dragos identified a persistent pattern of activity\nattempting to gather information and enumerate network resources associated with US and Asia-Pacific electric utilities.\nThis behavior could indicate the activity group was preparing for a further cyberattack, or at minimum satisfying the prerequisites\nfor a future ICS-focused intrusion. The activities are consistent with Stage 1 ICS Cyber Kill Chain  reconnaissance and initial access\noperations, including observed incidents of attempted authentication with credentials and possible credential “ stuffing ,” or using\nstolen usernames and passwords to try and force entry into target accounts.\nCause for Concern\nWhile none of the electric utility targeting events has resulted in a known, successful intrusion into victim organizations to date, the\npersistent attempts, and expansion in scope is cause for definite concern. XENOTIME has successfully compromised several oil and\ngas environments which demonstrates its ability to do so in other verticals. Specifically, XENOTIME remains one of only\nfour threats  (along with ELECTRUM , Sandworm , and the entities responsible for Stuxnet ) to execute a deliberate disruptive or\ndestructive attack.\nXENOTIME is the only known entity to specifically target safety instrumented systems  (SIS) for disruptive or destructive purposes.\nElectric utility environments are significantly different from oil and gas operations in several aspects, but electric operations still have\nsafety and protection equipment that could be targeted with similar tradecraft. XENOTIME expressing consistent, direct interest in\nelectric utility operations is a cause for deep concern given this adversary’s willingness to compromise process safety – and thus\nintegrity – to fulfill its mission.\nXENOTIME’s expansion to another industry vertical is emblematic of an increasingly hostile industrial threat landscape. Most\nobserved XENOTIME activity focuses on initial information gathering and access operations necessary for follow-on ICS intrusion\noperations. As seen in long-running state-sponsored intrusions into US, UK, and other electric infrastructure , entities are increasingly\ninterested in the fundamentals of ICS operations and displaying all the hallmarks associated with information and access acquisition\nnecessary to conduct future attacks. While Dragos sees no evidence at this time indicating that XENOTIME (or any other activity\ngroup, such as ELECTRUM  or ALLANITE ) is capable of executing a prolonged disruptive or destructive event on electric utility\noperations, observed activity strongly signals adversary interest in meeting the prerequisites for doing so.\nDefensive Recommendations\nAsset Identification and Environmental Awareness ICS asset owners and operators across all industries must prepare for\npotential breach and disruption scenarios. The most important thing a security team can do is improve visibility and awareness of ICS\nnetwork activity, chiefly through a combination of network observables, host-based logs, and process-specific data.\nThreat Behavior Detection ICS-specific threat intelligence can also be leveraged to identify unique threat behavior patterns,\nevolving adversary methodology, and specific conduct.\nInvestigation, Response, and Recovery When investigating or detecting ICS-specific intrusions and manipulation for hostile\npurposes, defenders must leverage all available information sources — from IT- like observations to process-specific impacts — and\nfuse them to gain a complete view of ICS network operations enabling informed response and root cause analysis of industrial\nincidents.\nGiven that XENOTIME is capable of and willing to execute a fundamental attack on process safety through attempted SIS\nmodification, asset owners and operators must begin planning now for response and recovery scenarios related to a loss of SIS\nintegrity . Specific items relating to response and recovery which can be immediately implemented include:\nIdentify vendor contacts for support and analysis on specialized equipment not amenable to standard IT-based investigation\ntechniques\nHave appropriate incident response capabilities either in-house or on call\nMaintain known-good configuration and process data both for comparison to possible compromised devices, and  to enable rapid\nrecovery in the event of a breach\nIdentify operational workarounds to maintain known-good, known-safe production or generating capability\nIrrespective of how an organization addresses these questions, ICS operators must address such concerns in advance, rather than\ntrying to figure out such sensitive, complex items mid- or post-intrusion.\nConclusion\nUltimately, XENOTIME’s expansion to an additional ICS vertical is deeply concerning given this entity’s willingness to undermine\nfundamental process safety in ICS environments placing lives and environments at great risk.\nDragos emphasizes that the observed behavior is an expansion, a proliferation of the threat, and not a shift – oil and gas entities\nmust still grapple with this adversary’s activity. While unfortunate, the expansion should serve as a clear signal to ICS operators – not\nonly in oil and gas or electric utility operations – that the time to plan, implement, and enforce security standards and response\nprocesses in industrial environments is now.\nFor policymakers and risk managers, it is important to note that cross-geography and cross-industry collaboration is critical. Critical\ninfrastructure cannot be siloed as the threat is operating across verticals and may even use one against the other; for instance,\ntargeting electric to deny power to an oil refinery. Utilities, companies, and governments must work cooperatively around the world\nand across industrial sectors to jointly defend lives and infrastructure from the increasing scope and scale of offensive critical\ninfrastructure cyber attack.\n \n Recent Blog Posts\nDragos 2019 Year in Review\nWebinar Q&A\nMarch 18, 2020\nSpyware Stealer Locker Wiper:\nLockerGoga Revisited\nMarch 17, 2020\nEnergy Organizations Continue\nto be Compromised Globally\nMarch 10, 2020\nDragos 2019 ICS Year in Review:\nExecutive Summary\nFebruary 20, 2020\nAssessment of Ransomware\nEvent at U.S. Pipeline Operator\nFebruary 19, 2020\n  Your mainline ICS feed:  @DragosInc\nPRODUCTS & SERVICES\nDragos Platform\nThreat Intelligence\nNeighborhood Keeper\nProfessional Services\nTrainingRESOURCES\nWhitepapers\nWebinars\nDatasheets & Brochures\nInfographics\nYear in Review\nAdversaries ReportsMEDIA\nNews\nPress Releases\nVideos\nPodcastsCOMPANY\nAbout Us\nAwards\nCareers\nDragos Industrial Security Conference\nEvents\nMeet the Team\n1745 Dorsey Rd\nHanover, Maryland 21076\n(855) 372-4670\ninfo@dragos.comExperienced an Incident?\nBlog\nContact Us\nTerms & Conditions\nCOPYRIGHT © 2020 DRAGOS, INC.
