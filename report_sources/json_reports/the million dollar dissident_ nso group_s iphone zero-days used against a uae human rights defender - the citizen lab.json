These updates patch the Trident vulnerabilities that identified in this report for\ndesktop users. The Trident vulnerabilities used by NSO could have been weaponized against\nusers of non iOS devices, including OSX. We encourage all Apple users to install the update\nas soon as possible . Citizen Lab is not releasing samples of the attack at this time to protect\nthe integrity of still-ongoing investigations.\nThis report describes how a government targeted an internationally recognized human\nrights defender, Ahmed Mansoor, with the Trident, a chain of zero-day exploits designed to\ninfect his iPhone with sophisticated commercial spyware.\n1. Executive Summary\nAhmed Mansoor is an internationally recognized human rights defender, based in the\nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE), and recipient of the Martin Ennals Award  (sometimes referred\nto as a “Nobel Prize for human rights ”).  On August 10 and 11, 2016, Mansoor received SMS\ntext messages on his iPhone promising “new secrets” about detainees tortured in UAE jails\nif he clicked on an included link. Instead of clicking, Mansoor sent the messages to Citizen\nLab researchers.  We recognized the links as belonging to an exploit infrastructure\nconnected to NSO Group, an Israel-based “cyber war” company that sells Pegasus, a\ngovernment-exclusive “lawful intercept” spyware product.  NSO Group is reportedly owned\nby an American venture capital firm, Francisco Partners Management.\nThe ensuing investigation, a collaboration between researchers from Citizen Lab and from\nLookout Security, determined that the links led to a chain of zero-day exploits  (“zero-days”)\nthat would have remotely jailbroken Mansoor’s stock iPhone 6 and installed sophisticated\nspyware.  We are calling this exploit chain  Trident.  Once infected, Mansoor’s phone would\nhave become a digital spy in his pocket, capable of employing his iPhone’s camera and\nmicrophone to snoop on activity in the vicinity of the device, recording his WhatsApp and\nViber calls, logging messages sent in mobile chat apps, and tracking his movements.  \nWe are not aware of any previous instance of an iPhone remote jailbreak used in the wild as\npart of a targeted attack campaign, making this a rare find.\nThe Trident Exploit Chain:\nCVE-2016-4657 : Visiting a maliciously cra ed website may lead to arbitrary code execution\nCVE-2016-4655 : An application may be able to disclose kernel memory\nCVE-2016-4656 : An application may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges\nOnce we confirmed the presence of what appeared to be iOS zero-days, Citizen Lab and\nLookout quickly initiated a responsible disclosure process by notifying Apple and sharing\nour findings. Apple responded promptly, and notified us that they would be addressing the\nvulnerabilities. We are releasing this report to coincide with the availability of the iOS 9.3.5\npatch, which blocks the Trident exploit chain by closing the vulnerabilities that NSO Group\nappears to have exploited and sold to remotely compromise iPhones.\nRecent Citizen Lab research has shown that many state-sponsored spyware campaigns\nagainst civil society groups and human rights defenders use “ just enough” technical\nsophistication, coupled with carefully planned deception. This case demonstrates that not\nall threats follow this pattern.  The iPhone has a well-deserved reputation for security.  As\nthe iPhone platform is tightly controlled by Apple, technically sophisticated exploits are\no en required to enable the remote installation and operation of iPhone monitoring tools.\nThese exploits are rare and expensive. Firms that specialize in acquiring zero-days o en pay\nhandsomely for iPhone exploits.  One such firm, Zerodium, acquired an exploit chain similar\nto the Trident for one million dollars  in November 2015.\nThe high cost of iPhone zero-days, the apparent use of NSO Group’s government-exclusive\nPegasus product, and prior known targeting of Mansoor  by the UAE government provide\nindicators that point to the UAE government as the likely operator behind the targeting.\nRemarkably, this case marks the third commercial “lawful intercept” spyware suite\nemployed in attempts to compromise Mansoor.  In 2011, he was targeted with FinFisher’s\nFinSpy spyware, and in 2012 he was targeted with Hacking Team’s Remote Control System.\n Both Hacking Team and FinFisher have been the object of several years of revelations\nhighlighting the misuse of spyware to compromise civil society groups, journalists, and\nhuman rights workers.\nFigure 1: Ahmed Mansoor, the “Million Dollar Dissident.”\nThe attack on Mansoor is further evidence that “lawful intercept” spyware has significant\nabuse potential, and that some governments cannot resist the temptation to use such tools\nagainst political opponents, journalists, and human rights defenders. Our findings also\nhighlight the continuing lack of e ective human rights policies and due diligence at spyware\ncompanies, and the continuing lack of incentives to address abuses of “lawful intercept”\nspyware.\nOur report proceeds as follows:\nSection 2 provides an overview of the attack against Ahmed Mansoor.\nSection 3 details NSO Group’s tradecra , gleaned from what appears to be a copy of\nNSO Group documentation leaked in the Hacking Team emails.\nSection 4 summarizes our technical analysis of the attack against Mansoor (in\ncollaboration with Lookout).\nSection 5 describes how we found what appears to be the NSO Group’s mobile attack\ninfrastructure while working on our previous Stealth Falcon  report.\nSection 6 links the spyware used in the attack on Mansoor to NSO Group.\nSection 7 outlines evidence of other individuals targeted with the infrastructure that\nwe linked to NSO Group, including Mexican journalist Rafael Cabrera.\nSection 8 explains how the attack on Mansoor fits into the context of ongoing attacks\non UAE dissidents.\nSection 9 concludes the report.\n \n2. Ahmed Mansoor Targeted With iPhone\nZero-Day\nAhmed Mansoor is an internationally recognized  human rights defender, blogger,\nand member of Human Rights Watch’s advisory committee .  Mansoor, who is based in the\nUAE, was jailed for eight months in 2011 along with four other activists for supporting a pro-\ndemocracy petition .  A er he was released, Mansoor’s passport was confiscated , his car was\nstolen, and $140,000 disappeared from his bank account.  Mansoor is banned from traveling\noverseas, and his work continues to attract significant harassment and punishment\nOn the morning of August 10, 2016, Mansoor received an SMS text message that appeared\nsuspicious. The next day he received a second, similar text. The messages promised “new\nsecrets” about detainees tortured in UAE prisons, and contained a hyperlink to an\nunfamiliar website. The messages arrived on Mansoor’s stock iPhone 6 running iOS 9.3.3.\nFigure 2: Ahmed Mansoor received suspicious text messages in August 2016.  Credit: Martin Ennals\nFoundation.\nMansoor quickly forwarded the messages to Citizen Lab researchers for investigation.  He\nhas good reason to be concerned about unsolicited messages: every year since 2011,\nMansoor has been targeted with spyware attacks, including with FinFisher spyware in 2011\nand Hacking Team  spyware in 2012 (see Section 8: Ahmed Mansoor and Previous UAE\nAttacks).\nFigure 3: SMS text messages received by Mansoor (English: “New secrets about torture of Emiratis in state\nprisons”).  The sender’s phone numbers are spoofed.\n \nWhen Mansoor’s messages reached us, we recognized the links: the domain name\nwebadv.co  belongs to a network of domains that we believe to be part of an exploit\ninfrastructure provided by the spyware company NSO Group (see Section 6: Linking NSO\nGroup Products to the Attack on Mansoor ).  We had first come across the NSO Group\ninfrastructure during the course of our earlier research into Stealth Falcon , a UAE-based\nthreat actor (see Section 5: Tracking a Mobile Attack Infrastructure ).  \nWhen we first found the infrastructure and connected it to NSO Group, we hypothesized\nthat operators of the NSO Group spyware would target a user by sending them an infection\nlink containing one of the exploit infrastructure domain names.  Though we had previously\nfound several public occurrences of links involving these domains on Twitter (see Section 7:\nEvidence of Other Targets ), none of the links we found seemed to be active (i.e., none\nproduced an infection when we tested them).  In other exploit infrastructures with which we\nare familiar (e.g., Hacking Team’s exploit infrastructure ), we had noted that operators prefer\nto deactivate such links a er a single click, or a er a short period of time, perhaps in order\nto prevent the disclosure of the exploit to security researchers.\nWe accessed the link Mansoor provided us on our own stock factory-reset iPhone 5\n(Mansoor had an iPhone 6) with iOS 9.3.3 (the same version as Mansoor).  When we clicked\nthe link, we saw that it was indeed active, and watched as unknown so ware was remotely\nimplanted on our phone.  This suggested that the link contained a zero-day iPhone remote\njailbreak: a chain of heretofore unknown exploits used to remotely circumvent iPhone\nsecurity measures.  To verify our observations, we shared our findings with Lookout\nSecurity.  Both research teams determined that Mansoor was targeted with a zero-day\niPhone remote jailbreak. The chain of exploits, which we are calling the Trident, included\nthe following (see Section 4: The Trident iOS Exploit Chain and Payload  for more details):\nCVE-2016-4657 : An exploit for WebKit, which allows execution of the initial shellcode\nCVE-2016-4655 : A Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) bypass\nexploit to find the base address of the kernel\nCVE-2016-4656 : 32 and 64 bit iOS kernel exploits that allow execution of code in the\nkernel, used to jailbreak the phone and allow so ware installation\nThe implant installed by the Trident exploit chain would have turned Mansoor’s iPhone into\na digital spy in his pocket. The spyware, which appears to be NSO’s Pegasus spyware\nsolution, was capable of employing his iPhone’s camera and microphone to eavesdrop on\nactivity in the vicinity of the device, recording his WhatsApp and Viber calls, logging\nmessages sent in mobile chat apps, and tracking his movements.\n \n3. NSO Group and the Pegasus Solution\nThe attack on Mansoor appears to have used Pegasus, a remote monitoring solution sold by\nNSO Group Technologies Ltd  (see Section 6: Linking NSO Group Products to the Attack on\nMansoor).  NSO Group, based in Herzelia, Israel (CR# 514395409), develops and sells mobile\nphone surveillance so ware to governments around the world.  The company describes\nitself as a “leader” in “ mobile and cellular Cyber Warfare ,” and has been operating for more\nthan six years since its founding in 2010.\nNSO Group appears to be owned by a private equity firm with headquarters in San\nFrancisco: Francisco Partners Management LLC , which reportedly acquired it in 2014 a er\napproval from the Israeli Defense Ministry .  However, as of November 2015, Francisco\nPartners was reportedly exploring  selling NSO Group, with a stated valuation of up to $1\nbillion. Interestingly, Francisco Partners previously invested in Blue Coat , a company selling\nnetwork filtering and monitoring solutions, whose technology has been used by repressive\nregimes according to previous Citizen Lab research .\nFigure 4: Image from an NSO Group brochure posted on SIBAT (The International Defense\nCooperation Directorate of the Israel Ministry of Defense).\nNSO Group has largely avoided the kind of high profile media attention that companies like\nHacking Team and FinFisher have sometimes courted. The company maintains no website,\nthere is little concrete information about NSO Group’s Pegasus product available online,\nand we know of no prior technical analysis of NSO Group’s products or infrastructure.\nSome previous media reports have linked NSO Group  and Pegasus  to a scandal involving\npotential illegal eavesdropping in Panama, and possible sales to Mexico .  Other reports have\nsuggested that NSO Group’s activities have aroused concern within the United States\nintelligence community .\nTwo of NSO Group’s three co-founders, Shalev Hulio and Omri Lavie, are also co-founders of\nmobile security company Kaymera, which promises a “Multi Layered Cyber Defense\nApproach” to clients.  On Kaymera’s website, the company reprints a Bloomberg article\npointing out that they “ play both sides of the cyber wars .”  The article also quotes NSO\nGroup’s CEO, who suggests that they entered the defense business when potential clients\nsaw the capabilities of NSO Group’s tools.\nFigure 5: Kaymera’s website promises comprehensive mobile security\n3.1. Pegasus Documents in Hacking Team Leak\nMuch of the publicly available information about Pegasus seems to be rumor, conjecture, or\nunverifiable claims made to media  about capabilities. However, when we examined the\nHacking Team emails  leaked online a er a 2015 breach, we found several instances of\nHacking Team clients or resellers sharing what appeared to be NSO Group’s product\ndocumentation and sales pitches.\nFor instance, in December 2014, a reseller of surveillance technologies to the Mexican\ngovernment forwarded a PDF document containing detailed technical specifications of NSO\nGroup’s Pegasus system to Hacking Team .  According to the document’s metadata, it\nappears to have been created in December 2013 by Guy Molho, who is listed on LinkedIn  as\nthe Director of Product Management at NSO Group.\n \n3.2. Device Infection\nAccording to the purported 2013 NSO Group Pegasus documentation found in the Hacking\nTeam materials, NSO Group o ers two remote installation vectors for spyware onto a\ntarget’s device: a zero-click vector, and a one-click vector.  The one-click vector involves\nsending the target a normal SMS text message with a link to a malicious website.  The\nmalicious website contains an exploit for the web browser on the target’s device, and any\nother required exploits to implant the spyware. In the attack against Mansoor, the Trident\nexploit chain was used.\nTo use NSO Group’s zero-click vector, an operator instead sends the same link via a special\ntype of SMS message, like a WAP Push Service Loading (SL) message .  A WAP Push SL\nmessage causes a phone to automatically open a link in a web browser instance, eliminating\nthe need for a user to click on the link to become infected. Many newer models of phones\nhave started ignoring or restricting WAP Push messages.  Mobile network providers may also\ndecide to block these messages.\nFigure 6: Diagram from purported NSO Group Pegasus documentation showing the sequence\nthrough which the spyware (“Agent”) is installed on a target’s mobile device.  Source: Hacking Team\nEmails.\nThe documentation refers to a malicious website employed in installation of the spyware\n(“Agent”) as an Anonymizer , which communicates with a Pegasus Installation Server\nlocated on the operator’s premises.  When a target visits a malicious link from their device,\nthe Anonymizer forwards the request to the Pegasus Installation Server, which examines the\ntarget device’s User-Agent  header to determine if Pegasus has an exploit chain, such as the\nTrident, that supports the device.\nIf the device is supported, the Pegasus Installation Server returns the appropriate exploit to\nthe target device through the Anonymizer and attempts an infection.  If infection fails for\nany reason, the target’s web browser will redirect to a legitimate website specified by the\nPegasus operator, in order to avoid arousing the target’s suspicion.\nIn the operation targeting Mansoor, the one-click vector was used, with anonymizer\nsms.webadv.co (see Section 4: The Trident iOS Exploit Chain and Payload for more\ndetails).\n \n3.3. Data Collection\nAccording to the purported NSO Group documentation, once successfully implanted on a\nphone using an exploit chain like the Trident, Pegasus can actively record or passively gather\na variety of di erent data about the device.  By giving full access to the phone’s files,\nmessages, microphone and video camera, the operator is able to turn the device into a\nsilent digital spy in the target’s pocket.\nFigure 7: Diagram from purported NSO Group Pegasus documentation\nshowing the range of information gathered from a device infected with\nPegasus.  Source: Hacking Team Emails.\nIn the spyware used in targeting Mansoor, we confirmed many elements of this functionality,\nand observed indications that the collection of the following types of data was supported,\namong others (see Section 4.2: The Payload  for more details):\nCalls made by phone, WhatsApp and Viber,\nSMS messages, as well as messages and other data from popular apps like Gmail,\nWhatsApp, Skype, Facebook, KakaoTalk, Telegram, and others,\nA wide range of personal data, such as calendar data and contact lists, as well as\npasswords, including Wi-Fi passwords.\n \n3.4. Exﬁltration\nAccording to the purported NSO Group documentation, an infected device transmits\ncollected information back to a Pegasus Data Server  at the operator’s premises, via the\nPATN (Pegasus Anonymizing Transmission Network).  The PATN appears to be a proxy chain\nsystem similar to Hacking Team’s anonymizers  and FinFisher’s relays . The chain is intended\nto obfuscate the identity of the government client associated with a particular operation.\n Once the collected information arrives on the Pegasus Data Server, an operator may\nvisualize the information on a Pegasus Working Station.\nFigure 8: A purported screenshot of NSO Group’s Pegasus Working Station so ware, which visualizes\nlocation data collected from infected devices (as of March 2012).  Source: Hacking Team Emails.\nThe implant in the attack targeting Mansoor communicated with two PATN nodes:\naalaan.tv and manoraonline.net .  The first of these, aalaan.tv, appears to be a lookalike\ndomain for the legitimate alaan.tv, a Gulf-based satellite television channel (see Section 5.2\nfor more details on lookalike domains observed in apparent NSO Group infrastructure).\n \n3.5. Prioritizing Stealth\nOne interesting design decision of NSO Group’s Pegasus system, according to the purported\nNSO Group documentation, is that it emphasizes stealth above almost all else.  As the\ndocumentation states:\nIn general, we understand that it is more important that the source will not be\nexposed and the target will suspect nothing than keeping the agent alive and\nworking.\nCertain Pegasus features are only enabled when the device is idle and the screen is o , such\nas “environmental sound recording” (hot mic) and “photo taking.”  The documentation also\nstates that the spyware implements a “self-destruct mechanism,” which may be activated\nautomatically “in cases where a great probability of exposing the agent exists.”  However,\nthe documentation claims that sometimes Pegasus removal can result in an infected device\nrebooting immediately a er removal.\n \n4. The Trident iOS Exploit Chain and Payload\nIn this section, we describe our technical analysis of the attack on Mansoor, including the\nTrident iOS Exploit chain and payload. Given the accelerated timeframe of this case, we are\npublishing the results of a preliminary  analysis.\nRecall that the investigation that led to the discovery of the Trident exploit chain began\nwhen UAE human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor forwarded to Citizen Lab two suspicious\nlinks that he received via SMS on his iPhone ( Section 2).  Suspecting the links to be iPhone\nspyware associated with NSO Group ( Section 6), we accessed them from our own stock\nfactory-reset iPhone 5 running iOS 9.3.3.  Mansoor’s device is an iPhone 6, running iOS 9.3.3;\nwe did not have an iPhone 6 available for testing.  Although the latest iOS version when\nMansoor received the links was 9.3.4, this version had been released only one week\nbeforehand .\nWe accessed the links by opening Safari on our iPhone, and manually transcribing the links\nfrom the screenshots that Mansoor sent.  A er about ten seconds of navigating to the URL,\nwhich displayed a blank page, the Safari window closed, and we observed no further visual\nactivity on the iPhone’s screen.  Meanwhile, we saw that the phone was served what\nappeared to be a Safari exploit, followed by intermediate files ( final111), and a final\npayload ( test111.tar ). The first two payloads form the Trident exploit chain, and test111.tar\nis the payload.\nFigure 9: Requests from our phone to sms.webadv.co as we clicked on the malicious link.  The first\nrequest is our click on the link.  The requests for ntf_bed.html, ntf_brc.html, and test111.tar are\nconducted by a stage2 binary (in final111).  All previous requests are conducted by Safari.\nSuspecting what we had observed to be the work of a zero-day iPhone remote jailbreak, we\nshared the exploit and payloads with colleagues at Lookout Security, initiated a responsible\ndisclosure process with Apple, and sent Apple the exploit and payloads.\n \n4.1. The Trident Exploit Chain\nThis section provides a high-level overview of the Trident exploit chain used in the attack\nagainst Mansoor.  For further details, see Lookout’s report .\nWhen a user opens the links sent to Mansoor on an iPhone, a stage1 containing obfuscated\nJavaScript is downloaded. The JavaScript downloads (via XMLHttpRequest) stage2 binaries\nfor either 32-bit (iPhone 5 and earlier) or 64-bit (iPhone 5s and later), depending on the type\nof device.  The stage1 employs a previously undocumented memory corruption\nvulnerability in WebKit to execute this code within the context of the Safari browser (CVE-\n2016-4657).\nThe stage2 exploits a function that returns a kernel memory address, from which the base\naddress of the kernel can be mapped (CVE-2016-4655).  The stage2 then employs a memory\ncorruption vulnerability in the kernel (CVE-2016-4656).  This last vulnerability is employed to\ndisable code signing enforcement, allowing the running of unsigned binaries.  The stage2\ndownloads and installs the stage3, which is the spyware payload.\n \n4.2. The Payload\nThis section provides a high-level overview of the functionality of the spyware payload.  For\nmore details, see Lookout’s report .\n4.2.1. Persistence\nThe Trident is re-run locally on the phone at each boot, using the JavaScriptCore binary.  To\nfacilitate persistence, the spyware disables Apple’s automatic updates, and detects and\nremoves other jailbreaks.\n4.2.2. Recording\nThe attack payload includes a renamed copy of Cydia Substrate , a third-party app developer\nframework, which it uses to help facilitate recording of messages and phone calls from\ntargeted apps.  To record WhatsApp and Viber calls, the spyware injects WhatsApp and Viber\nusing the Cydia Substrate, hooks various call status methods, and sends system-wide\nnotifications when call events occur; the spyware listens for these notifications and starts or\nstops recording as appropriate.  It appears that the payload can spy on apps including:\niMessage, Gmail, Viber, Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, Skype, Line, KakaoTalk, WeChat,\nSurespot, Imo.im, Mail.Ru, Tango, VK, and Odnoklassniki.\nThe spyware also exfiltrates calendar and contact data, as well as passwords saved in the\nphone’s keychain, including Wi-Fi passwords and networks.\n4.2.3. Exfiltration\nThe attack payload beacons back to command and control (C2) servers delivered in stage2\nof the Trident, via HTTPS.  One of the binaries in the stage2 of the link sent to Mansoor\ncontained the following string:\nWW91ciBHb29nbGUgdmVyaWZpY2F0aW9uIGNvZGUgaXM6NTY3ODQyOQpodHRwOi8vZ21haWwuY29tLz96PUZFY0NBQT0\n9Jmk9TVRwaFlXeGhZVzR1ZEhZNk5EUXpMREU2YldGdWIzSmhiMjVzYVc1bExtNWxkRG8wTkRNPSZzPXpwdnpQU1lTNj\nc0PQ==\nThe Base64 string decodes to:\nYour Google verification code is:5678429\nhttp://gmail.com/?\nz=FEcCAA==&i=MTphYWxhYW4udHY6NDQzLDE6bWFub3Jhb25saW5lLm5ldDo0NDM=&s=zpvzPSYS674=\nThis appears designed to look like a text message from Google containing a two-factor\nauthentication code, though legitimate Google messages of this type do not contain a link,\nand contain one fewer digit in the verification code.  Base64-decoding the “i” parameter of\nthe URL yields:\n1:aalaan.tv:443,1:manoraonline.net:443\nThese are the C2 servers for the spyware sent to Mansoor: aalaan.tv and\nmanoraonline.net .\nA similar obfuscation appears to be used for exchange of information over SMS between an\ninfected phone and the C2 Server.  In case the spyware’s C2 servers are disabled or\nunreachable, an operator may deliver updated C2 servers to an infection using this type of\nSMS, similar to FinFisher’s “ emergency configuration update ” functionality.\n \n5. Tracking a Mobile Attack Infrastructure\nThis section explains how we first identified what appeared to be a mobile attack\ninfrastructure while tracking Stealth Falcon.  We then outline some basic observations about\nthe infrastructure, including themes in the domain names used by the attackers.  We link the\ninfrastructure we found to NSO Group in Section 6 .\n \n5.1. Stealth Falcon  Leads Us to a Mobile Attack Infrastructure\nA year or so before Ahmed Mansoor received his suspicious SMS messages, we were tracking\nStealth Falcon , a threat actor targeting individuals critical of the UAE government at home\nand abroad, several of whom were later arrested. For full details on Stealth Falcon, read our\nMay 2016 report .\nIn the course of our investigation, we traced Stealth Falcon’s spyware to dozens of di erent\ncommand and control (C2) domains. One server that matched our C2 fingerprint for Stealth\nFalcon’s custom spyware, icloudcacher.com , was connected to the email address\npn1g3p@sigaint.org , according to data in its DNS SOA record.  The same email address\nappeared in WHOIS records for the following three domains:\nasrarrarabiya.com\nasrararabiya.co\nasrararablya.com\nThese domains did not match our Stealth Falcon fingerprint. As we examined the domains,\nhowever, we found that the index page on these domains contained an iframe pointing to\nthe website asrararabiya.com ( Asrar Arabiya , or “Arabian Secrets” in English), which appears\nto be a benign website  that takes a critical view of the Arab World’s “dictatorships.”  The\nindex page also contained a nearly invisible iframe pointing to an odd looking site,\nsmser.net.\n<iframe src=\"https://smser.net/9918216t/\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\"></iframe>\n<iframe src=\"http://asrararabiya.com/\" style=\"width:100%; height:1200px; position:absolute;  \ntop:-5px; left:-5px;\" border=\"0\"></iframe>\nFigure 10  : HTML content of the index page on the three fake “Asrar Arabiya” domains.\nWe suspect that the three domains we identified were attempting to mislead users into\nbelieving they were visiting the legitimate asrararabiya.com website.  Since we had linked\nthe operation to Stealth Falcon, we suspected that the additional domain, smser.net, might\nbe an attack domain.  We visited the URL in the iframe, https://smser.net/9918216t/ , and\nwere redirected to https://smser.net/redirect.aspx.\n<html><head><meta http-equiv='refresh' content='0;url=http://www.google.com' /><meta http-\nequiv='refresh' content='1;url=http://www.google.com' /><title></title></head><body></body>\n</html>\nFigure 11 : HTML content of https://smser.net/redirect.aspx.  The page tells the web browser to redirect the\nvisitor to Google.\nWe devised a number of fingerprints for various behaviors of smser.net, checked Shodan\nand Censys, and conducted our own scanning with zmap to identify related servers.  We\nfound 237 live IP addresses, and extracted their domain names from the SSL certificates\nreturned by the each server.  The SSL certificates we found included *.webadv.co ,\nmanoraonline.net , and aalaan.tv, the three domains in the spyware attack sent to\nMansoor.\nWe linked these IPs and domain names to what appears to be NSO Group exploit\ninfrastructure.\n \n5.2. Coding the Domain Names\nWe coded the domain names we found, and identified several common themes, perhaps\nindicating the type of bait content that targets would receive.  Interestingly, the most\ncommon theme among the domains we identified was “News Media,” perhaps indicating\nthe use of fake news articles to trick targets into clicking on spyware links.  An example of\none such attack in action is the targeting of Mexican journalist Rafael Cabrera ( Section 7.1 ).\nWe also noted the prevalence of themes we had seen in other spearphishing attacks, e.g.,\nonline accounts, document sharing, shipment tracking, corporate account portals. Another\ncommon theme was ISPs, perhaps because a target may trust an SMS appearing to come\nfrom an ISP or Telco they subscribe to.\nFigure 12: Most commonly recurring domain name themes.\n \nAlarmingly, some of the names suggested a willingness on the part of the operators to\nimpersonate governments and international organizations. For example, we found two\ndomain names that appear intended to masquerade as an o icial site of the International\nCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC):  icrcworld.com  and redcrossworld.com .\nWe also identified the domain  topcontactco.com which may be a lookalike for\ntpcontact.co.uk , a website belonging to Teleperformance, a company that has managed UK\nvisa application processing in many countries.\nFigure 13: Screenshot from an article published by the UK Government on how to apply for a\nvisa. https://www.gov.uk/government/world-location-news/how-to-apply-for-a-uk-visa\nVisa applicants are required to visit the legitimate tpcontact.co.uk website  as part of the\nonline visa application process. We found similar evidence of government-themed sites\nhinting at Mexico and Kenya.\nThe following table provides further examples of themes found in the domain names.\nType Example Impersonating\nNews Mediaalljazeera.co\nbbc-africa.com\ncnn-africa.co\nunonoticias.net\nunivision.clickAljazeera\nBBC\nCNN\nLas Ultimas Noticias\nUnivision\nShipment Tracking track-your-fedex-package.org FedEx\nISP / Telcomz-vodacom.info\niusacell-movil. com.mx\nsabafon.info\nnewtarrifs.netVodacom (Mozambique)\nIusacell (Mexico)\nSabafon (Yemen)\nGeneric\nPopular Online\nPlatformsy0utube.com.mx\nfb-accounts.com\ngoogleplay-store.com\nwhatsapp-app.comYouTube\nFacebook\nGoogle\nWhatsApp\nAccount Info.

Our criteria was whether the domain name contained the name of a\ntelecom provider, ISP, local website, government service, geographic location, a country’s\nTLD, or the name of a country.\nThe UAE and Mexico dominate this list, although other countries are also worth noting,\nincluding: Turkey, Israel, Thailand, Qatar, Kenya, Uzbekistan, Mozambique, Morocco, Yemen,\nHungary, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, and Bahrain.\nFigure 14: Country theme based on domain name.\n \nCitizen Lab is refraining from publishing a full list of domain names at this time given the\npossibility that some domains may have been used in legitimate law enforcement\noperations.\n \n6. Linking NSO Group Products to the Attack\non Mansoor\nIn this section, we explain why we believe the attack on Ahmed Mansoor incorporated the\nuse of NSO Group’s Pegasus product.  We explain how we connected the domain name in the\nlink that Ahmed Mansoor received, sms.webadv.co , to a network of domain names that we\nhad mapped out while working on the May 2016 Stealth Falcon report  (Section 5 ). We also\nhighlight links to the UAE.\n \n6.1. Spyware Points to NSO Group’s Pegasus Solution\nThe final payload that we identified, test111.tar, contained several files, including\nlibaudio.dylib , which appeared to be the base library for call recording, libimo.dylib , which\nappeared to be the library for recording chat messages from apps, and two libraries for\nWhatsApp and Viber call recording: libvbcalls.dylib , and libwacalls.dylib .  In each file, we\nfound several hundred strings containing the text “_kPegasusProtocol,” the name of NSO\nGroup’s solution.\n_kPegasusProtocolAgentControlElement_iv\n_kPegasusProtocolAgentControlElement_key\n_kPegasusProtocolAgentControlElement_ciphertext\n_kPegasusProtocolProtocolElement_iv\n_kPegasusProtocolProtocolElement_key\n_kPegasusProtocolProtocolElement_ciphertext\n_kPegasusProtocolResponseElement_iv\n_kPegasusProtocolResponseElement_key\n_kPegasusProtocolResponseElement_ciphertext\nFigure 15 : “Pegasus” strings in the payload.\n \n6.2. Historical Scanning Data Connects Mansoor Attack to NSO\nGroup-linked Infrastructure\nThe links sent to Mansoor used the domain sms.webadv.co . The network of 237 live IP\naddresses we mapped ( Section 5) included 52.8.153.44 , to which sms.webadv.co  resolves,\nand which returns an SSL certificate for *.webadv.co . The 237 IPs also included 52.8.52.166\n(aalaan.tv) and 162.209.103.68  (manoraonline.net ), which were the two C2 servers in the\nspyware used in targeting Mansoor.\nHowever, the 237 IPs and related domain names that we mapped did not provide insight\ninto the identity of the threat actor. The IP addresses all appeared to be associated with\ncloud VPS providers, which gave no clue as to the identities of the operators, and the WHOIS\ninformation was mostly private. We did note that several domain names had WHOIS\nregistrants based in Israel (e.g., thainews.asia , kenyasms.org ).\nWe examined historical scanning data  to see whether we could attribute the 237 IPs to a\nthreat actor.  We noted that at least 19 of these IPs had previously returned a di erent\ndistinctive Google redirect in response to a “GET /”.\n\\xef\\xbb\\xbf<HTML><HEAD><META HTTP-EQUIV=\"refresh\"  \nCONTENT=\"0;URL=http://www.google.com/\">\\r\\n<TITLE></TITLE></HEAD><BODY>\\r\\n</BODY></HTML>\nFigure 16 : Response to an HTTP GET exhibited by 19 IPs in historical scanning data (note that the first three\nbytes represent the unicode byte order mark — BOM).\nThese 19 IPs included an IP address that (later) resolved to manoraonline.net , one of the C2\nservers for the spyware sent to Mansoor.\nWe then searched the same historical data for other IP addresses that matched this same\nfingerprint.  Overall, between October 2013 and September 2014, we identified 83 IPs that\nmatched the fingerprint.  We found several IPs of particular interest.  The IP address\n82.80.202.200  matched our fingerprint from October 2013 until April 2014.\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html\nLast-Modified: Tue, 04 Jun 2013 15:28:04 GMT\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nETag: \"09a91b3861ce1:0\"\nServer: Microsoft-IIS/7.5\nDate: Mon, 28 Oct 2013 21:23:12 GMT\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 127\n\\xef\\xbb\\xbf<HTML><HEAD><META HTTP-EQUIV=\"refresh\" CONTENT=\"0;URL=http://www.google.com/\">\n<TITLE></TITLE></HEAD><BODY>\n</BODY></HTML>\nThe domain name qaintqa.com  pointed to this IP address at the same time (from April 2013\nto April 2016), according to DomainTools.  The registrant information for this domain is:\nRegistrant Street:         Medinat Hayehudim 85\nRegistrant City:           hertzliya\nRegistrant State/Province: central\nRegistrant Postal Code:    46766\nRegistrant Country:        IL\nRegistrant Phone:          972542228649\nRegistrant Email:          lidorg@nsogroup.com\nWe also found two other IP addresses of interest that matched the fingerprint:\n82.80.202.204  and 54.251.49.214 matched the fingerprint in March 2014.  The former was\npointed to by mail1.nsogroup.com  from 2014-09-24 to 2015-05-06 (PassiveTotal), the latter\nwas pointed to by nsoqa.com  from 2015-09-01 until present (DomainTools).  Both domains\nare registered to NSO Group.\nGiven these findings, we strongly suspected the network of domain names we uncovered\nwas part of an exploit infrastructure for NSO Group’s mobile spyware.\n \n6.3. Additional UAE Infrastructure\nRecall that our first window into this infrastructure came from our Stealth Falcon research,\nwhen we identified the smser.net domain, fingerprinted it, and traced it to 237 live IP\naddresses that shared the same characteristics ( Section 5.1 ).\nUsing PassiveTotal , we were able to further trace smser.net to seven other\ndomains, indicating Stealth Falcon targeting that appeared to use NSO Group’s Pegasus\nsolution in Qatar ( ooredoodeals.com ), UAE ( alawaeltech.com , which may be a fake mobile\nphone company based in the Emirate of Ajman ), and Bahrain ( bahrainsms.co ).  Based on\nour previously published research , we believe there is strong circumstantial evidence to\nsupport the conclusion that the operator of Stealth Falcon is connected to an entity within\nthe UAE Government.\nWe also identified five .ae TLDs that all shared the same registrant name (“Gerald Binord”),\nwhich may have been used to target people in the UAE.  We further identified another group\nof domains including damanhealth.online  (“Daman Health” is a UAE-based health insurer )\nand uaenews.online , which also included a domain turkeynewsupdates.com , suggesting\nan operator that is targeting both UAE and Turkey targets.\n \n7. Evidence of Other Targets\nIn two cases, Mexico and Kenya, we found evidence of other targets who may have been\ntargeted with NSO Group’s Pegasus, based on messages they sent or received containing\nlinks that involve domain names we traced to what appears to be a mobile attack\ninfrastructure associated with NSO Group’s Pegasus (see Section 5: Tracking a Mobile\nAttack Infrastructure ).\n \n7.1. Mexico: Politically Motivated Targeting?\nIn the case of Mexico, one target appears to be the journalist Rafael Cabrera, who recently\nreported on the Casa Blanca controversy , a reported conflict of interest involving the\nPresident and First Lady of Mexico.  On August 30, 2015 the journalist Cabrera tweeted that\nhe had received suspicious messages purporting to come from Mexican television station\nUNO TV.  His tweet included screencaptures of the messages, which said that Mexico’s\nPresidency was considering defamation claims and imprisonment of reporters related to\nthe Casa Blanca report that Cabrera had worked on.\nFigure 17: Messages  purporting to come from UNO TV suggesting that a story he was linked to might\nresult in defamation charges or incarceration.

These match two domain names we linked to the\napparent NSO Group infrastructure.  A director at UNO TV responded to  Cabrera’s Tweet,\nsaying that these were “ …not our messages 100%.”\nFigure 18:  A director from UNO TV states that the suspicious SMS messages sent to Cabrera were not\nfrom his company. Image via Twitter.\n \nWe were unable to achieve a successful infection from either link sent to Cabrera,\npresumably because the links were several months old when we found them, and had been\nclicked on either by Cabrera himself, or by other interested parties who saw Cabrera’s tweet.\nContinuing our investigation, we made contact with Cabrera and learned that he had been\nrecently targeted with an additional series of messages containing suspicious links.\nFigure 19: Additional SMS messages sent to Rafael Cabrera containing links to the exploit infrastructure.\nScreenshots courtesy of Rafael Cabrera.\nThe English translations of the messages are as follows (clockwise from top-le ):\nFacebook reports e orts to access the account of: Rafael Cabrara.

Kenya: A Tweet Discussing the Opposition\nIn the case of Kenya, we found a past tweet containing a link to the NSO Group exploit\ninfrastructure from June 3, 2015.  The tweet, sent by a “ Senior Research O icer ” in the\nO ice of the Senate Minority Leader, references Moses Wetangula , who is the current\nMinority Leader of Kenya’s Senate.\nFigure 20: A Kenya-related link to apparent NSO Group infrastructure.\n8. Ahmed Mansoor and Previous UAE Attacks\nIn this section, we provide an overview of previous attacks we have documented against\nAhmed Mansoor, and other UAE dissidents.  The technical sophistication of previous attacks\nwe observed pales in comparison to the present attack.\nAhmed Mansoor has been a frequent target of past electronic attacks.  In March 2011, he\nwas targeted with FinFisher spyware disguised as a PDF of a pro-democracy petition he had\npreviously signed.  The spyware arrived in the form of an executable file inside a .rar file\nattached to an email.  Mansoor noticed that the file was an EXE file rather than a PDF, and\ndid not open it.  Mansoor and four other activists (the “UAE Five”) were imprisoned in April\n2011, and charged with insulting the leaders of the UAE.  Mansoor and the others were\npardoned in November of the same year.\nIn July of 2012, Ahmed Mansoor’s laptop was infected with Hacking Team spyware  delivered\nvia a booby-trapped Microso  Word document exploiting an old Microso  O ice\nvulnerability, CVE 2010-3333.  The spyware sent information from his computer to a UAE\nintelligence agency, apparently operating under the auspices of the o ice of Sheikh\nTahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a son of the founder of the UAE, and now the UAE Deputy\nNational Security Advisor.  Attackers broke into Mansoor’s email account shortly a er the\ninfection.  We assisted Mansoor in recovering from the attack.  Another UAE-based human\nrights activist, and a UAE-based journalist were also targeted in the same operation.\nIn early 2013, Mansoor was sent a link to a website that attempted to install spyware on his\ncomputer by exploiting a public Java vulnerability for which no patch had yet been issued.\n He realized the link was suspicious and did not click on it.  Throughout 2013 and 2014,\nMansoor was unsuccessfully targeted several times with spyware, mostly XTremeRAT,\nSpyNet RAT, and njRAT  delivered as executable files in attachments or through Google Drive\nlinks.  In 2014, Mansoor’s Twitter account was hacked .\nIn a campaign stretching from 2012 until 2016, UAE dissidents at home and abroad were\ntargeted by Stealth Falcon , an attacker likely linked to a UAE government agency.  Stealth\nFalcon sent out links involving a fake URL shortener that employed Javascript to profile\ntargets’ computers, checked which antivirus programs they had installed, and attempted to\ndeanonymize them if they were using Tor.  Stealth Falcon also sent out Microso  Word\ndocuments containing custom spyware that was installed if a user enabled macros.  Targets\nincluded five dissidents who were later arrested or convicted in absentia, as well as Rori\nDonaghy, a UK-based journalist who had been publishing articles about leaked emails\ninvolving members of the UAE government.\n \n9. Conclusion\nIn this report, we identify a highly technically sophisticated attack involving a zero-day\niPhone remote jailbreak — Trident — which installs spyware on a phone whose user clicks\njust once on a malicious link.  We connected the attack to NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware\nsuite, sold exclusively to government agencies by Israel-based NSO Group.  We made the\nconnection based on our previous work tracing a group of servers that appeared to be part\nof an infrastructure for attacking mobile phones.  Long before Ahmed Mansoor had\nforwarded us any suspicious links he received, we had mapped out a set of 237 servers\n(Section 5), and linked this set to NSO Group ( Section 6).  When Mansoor sent us\nscreencaptures of the SMS messages containing the links, we immediately matched the\nlinks’ domain name to our list of suspected servers associated with NSO Group’s Pegasus.\nWe visited the links Mansoor sent us from a colleague’s factory-reset stock iPhone, and\nmanaged to capture the exploits and payload, as the phone was infected.  We shared these\nartifacts with Lookout to gain more insight into the technical capabilities of the exploits and\nspyware, and with Apple as part of a responsible disclosure process.  Apple has been highly\nresponsive, and has worked very quickly to develop and issue a patch in the form of iOS\n9.3.5, approximately 10 days a er our initial report to them.  Once an iPhone is updated to\nthis most recent version, it will be immediately protected against the Trident exploit chain\nused in this attack.  While we assume that NSO Group and others will continue to develop\nreplacements for the Trident, we hope that our experience encourages other researchers to\npromptly and responsibly disclose such vulnerabilities to Apple and to other vendors.\nWhat Can You Do?\nAll iPhone owners should update to the latest version of iOS (9.3.5) immediately . If you’re unsure what version\nyou’re running, you can check it yourself  by tapping Settings > General > About > Version.\nCitizen Lab agrees with Apple  that users should avoid opening or downloading items from messages and\nwebsites unless they are certain that they come from a legitimate, trusted source. If you uncertain about the\nsource, you should not click the link or open the file . If you believe you have been the victim of a targeted\nattack, should consider sharing it with a trusted expert. If you suspect you have been the target of this attack,\nplease contact the Citizen Lab at info@citizenlab.org .\nZero-day exploits are expensive and rare, especially one-click remote jailbreak exploits for\niPhones, like the Trident.  Such exploits can fetch hundreds of thousands  or even a million\nPrivacy Policy  Unless otherwise noted this site and its contents are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Canada  license. \ndollars.  While Citizen Lab research has shown that many state-sponsored spyware\ncampaigns against civil society groups and human rights defenders use “ just enough”\ntechnical sophistication, coupled with carefully planned deception, the attack on Mansoor\ndemonstrates that not all threats follow this pattern.\nThis is the third time Mansoor has been targeted with “lawful intercept” spyware; Mansoor\nwas targeted in 2011 with spyware from FinFisher (based in Germany and the UK), in 2012\nwith spyware from Hacking Team (based in Italy), and now in 2016 with what appears to be\nspyware from NSO Group (based in Israel and reportedly owned by a US firm).  That the\ncompanies whose spyware was used to target Mansoor are all owned and operated from\ndemocracies speaks volumes about the lack of accountability and e ective regulation in the\ncross-border commercial spyware trade.\nWhile these spyware tools are developed in democracies, they continue to be sold to\ncountries with notorious records of abusive targeting of human rights defenders. Such sales\noccur despite the existence of applicable export controls.  For example, Israel’s export\nregime incorporates the dual-use technology controls of the Wassenaar Arrangement ,\nincluding those related to “intrusion so ware.” As such, NSO Group would presumably be\nrequired to obtain a license to export its products to the UAE.  If NSO Group did submit a\nlicense application, the human rights abuses perpetrated by the UAE, including the misuse\nof “lawful intercept” capabilities, must not have outweighed authorities’ other motivations\nto approve the export.\nClearly, additional legal and regulatory scrutiny of the the “lawful intercept” market, and of\nNSO Group’s activities in relation to the attacks we have described, is essential.  Citizen Lab\nand others have repeatedly demonstrated that advanced “lawful intercept” spyware\nenables some governments and agencies, especially those operating without strong\noversight, to target and harass journalists, activists and human rights workers. If spyware\ncompanies are unwilling to recognize the role that their products play in undermining\nhuman rights, or address these urgent concerns, they will continue to strengthen the case\nfor further intervention by governments and other stakeholders.\nNote: We are not releasing the malicious files at this time to protect the integrity of ongoing\ninvestigations.\n \nAcknowledgements\nSpecial thanks to the team at Lookout that we collaborated with in our investigation,\nespecially: Max Bazaliy, Andrew Blaich, Kristy Edwards, Michael Flossman, Seth Hardy, and\nMike Murray.\nVery special thanks to our talented Citizen Lab colleagues, especially: Ron Deibert, Sarah\nMcKune, Claudio Guarnieri, Adam Sen , Irene Poetranto, and Masashi Nishihata.\nSpecial thanks to the teams at Apple Inc. with whom we have been in contact for their\nprompt and forthright engagement during the disclosure and patching process.\nSpecial thanks to Nicholas Weaver for supplying the iPhone that we infected in Section 4.\n Special thanks to Zakir Durumeric.\nSpecial thanks to TNG and others who provided invaluable assistance, including with\ntranslation, but requested to remain anonymous.\nThanks to PassiveTotal.\nCitizen Lab’s research into targeted threats against civil society is supported by the John D\nand Catherine T MacArthur Foundation .
