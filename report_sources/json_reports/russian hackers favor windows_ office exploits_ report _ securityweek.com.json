State‐sponsored\nactors have been focusing on widely adopted software, and only 46% of the known Russian\nAPT exploited vulnerabilities can be also found in exploit kits used by cyber criminals.\nDubbed “ Running for Office: Russian APT Toolkits Revealed ,” Recorded Future’s report  also\nreveals that there might be no connection between APT28 and APT29, two of the most active\nactors. The former, which is also known as Fancy Bear, Operation Pawn Storm, Sednit, and\nSofacy , is associated by many with Russian military intelligence (GRU), while the latter, also\ncalled Cozy Bear, The Dukes, and Office Monkeys, is possibly associated with the Russian\nFederal Security Service (FSB).\nOf the 33 known exploited product vulnerabilities that various Russian APTs use to steal\ninformation, 27 are tied to APT28 (22) and APT29 (5), but they don’t overlap, although both\nwere found to have compromised  the Democratic National Committee (DNC) network.\nAPT29 managed to infiltrate the network last year, while APT28 compromised it in April this\nyear.\nAlongside these two groups, the alleged Russian state‐sponsored groups Energetic Bear  (also\nknown as Dragonfly, Group 24, Koala Team) and Turla  (aka Snake, Ouroboros, Carbon) also\nregularly target Microsoft products, the report claims. The massive user bases these products\nenjoy make them targets of choice: Windows has over 1.5 billion users, while Office has\nover 1.2 billion.\nIn addition to Microsoft products, these groups also focus on exploiting vulnerable Adobe\nsoftware, including Flash Player and Acrobat, Oracle products, such as Java, Mozilla\napplications, and community software. According to Recorded Future’s report, only 73% of\nvulnerabilities targeted by Russian APTs have public exploits available on portals such as\nMetasploit, Exploit Database and Github.\nSome of these vulnerabilities include CVE‐2015‐1701 and CVE‐2015‐3043 , both associated\nwith APT28 last year, CVE‐2015‐7645 , patched in October by Adobe, and CVE‐2015‐1641 ,\ncurrently one of the most popular Office flaws, alongside CVE‐2015‐2545. CVE‐2012‐0158 ,\nanother highly abused vulnerability in Office, is also targeted by these groups.\nAlthough these groups are still targeting vulnerabilities discovered seven or six years ago\n(such as CVE‐2009‐1123, CVE‐2010‐3333, and CVE‐2010‐4398) in Microsoft products, they don’t\nuse flaws that have been reported this year. The only new exploit is CVE‐2016‐0728 , used by\nAPT28 to target Linux machines.\nThe attack tactics employed by these groups are similar to those used by other threat actors,\nsuch as spear‐phishing, spoofed domains supporting credential phishing, social engineering\nand watering hole attacks. The security researchers claim that Office and Acrobat are popular\ntargets among them because of attacks that use attachments in spear‐phishing emails. Of the\n33 analyzed vulnerabilities, 8 impact Office/Acrobat.\n“Heavy Russian APT use of Office and Adobe PDF exploits may be in line with the more\ntargeted nature of state‐sponsored attacks. Criminal campaigns such as ransomware play a\nnumbers game, while state‐sponsored attacks focus on specific organizations and\ninformation,” the report reveals.\nWhen looking at the 22 exploits used by APT28 and the 5 employed by APT29, researchers\ndiscovered that they are different, meaning that the two groups are not connected. Previous\nreports also suggested  that the two groups do not coordinate or share resources and\ninfrastructure. Although both actors infiltrated DNC, they did so by unwittingly stealing the\nsame set of credentials, researchers say.\nRelated:  XTunnel Malware Specifically Built for DNC Hack\nRelated:  Hacking of DNC Raises Fears of Cyber Attack on U.S. Election\n Search\nBusiness Email AddressSUBSCRIBE TO THE DAILY BRIEFING\n   \n   \n    \nMost Recent Most Read\nHow National Security Surveillance Nabs More\nThan Spies\nEuropean Authorities Dismantle Two SIM Hijacking\nGangs\nUS Surveillance Powers Set to Temporarily Expire\nFlaws in Popup Builder Plugin Impacted Over\n100,000 WordPress Sites\nMicrosoft Deprecates Remote Desktop\nConnection Manager\nCritical Flaw in VMware Workstation, Fusion Allows\nCode Execution on Host From Guest\nChina‐linked APT Hackers Launch Coronavirus‐\nThemed Attacks\nU.S. Senators Seek to Ban TikTok on Government\nDevices\nTrump Signs Bill to Help Telecoms Replace Huawei\nEquipment\nHouse Strikes Deal to Extend Surveillance Powers\nPopular Topics\nInformation Security News\nIT Security News\nRisk Management\nCybercrime\nCloud Security\nApplication Security\nSmart Device Security\nSecurity Community\nIT Security Newsletters\nICS Cyber Security Conference\nCISO Forum, Presented by Intel\nInfosecIsland.Com\nStay Intouch\nTwitter\nFacebook\nLinkedIn Group\nCyber Weapon Discussion\nGroup\nRSS Feed\nSubmit Tip\nSecurity Intelligence Group\nAbout SecurityWeek\nTeam\nAdvertising\nEvents\nWriting Opportunities\nFeedback\nContact Us\nCopyright © 2020 Wired Business Media.
