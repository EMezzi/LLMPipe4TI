(DGI)\nProject CameraShy: Introduction7\nExecutive Summary\nThreatConnect®, in partnership with Defense Group Inc., has attributed targeted cyber espionage infrastructure activity \nassociated with the “Naikon” Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group to the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) \nChengdu Military Region Second Technical Reconnaissance Bureau (Military Unit Cover Designator 78020). This \nassessment is based on technical analysis of Naikon threat activity and native language research on a PLA officer \nwithin Unit 78020 named Ge Xing.\nFor nearly five years, Unit 78020 has used an array of global midpoint infrastructure to proxy the command and \ncontrol of customized malware variants embedded within malicious attachments or document exploits. These \nmalicious attachments are operationalized within spear phishing campaigns that establish beachheads into target \norganizations, facilitating follow on exploitation activities.\nUnit 78020 conducts cyber espionage against Southeast Asian military, diplomatic, and economic targets. The \ntargets include government entities in Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, the Philippines, \nSingapore, Thailand, and Vietnam as well as international bodies such as United Nations Development Programme \n(UNDP) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). \nWe assess Unit 78020’s focus is the disputed, resource-rich South China Sea, where China’s increasingly aggressive \nassertion of its territorial claims has been accompanied by high-tempo intelligence gathering. The strategic implications \nfor the United States include not only military alliances and security partnerships in the region, but also risks to a major \nartery of international commerce through which trillions of dollars in global trade traverse annually.\nThis report applies the Department of Defense-derived Diamond Model for Intrusion Analysis1 to a body of technical \nand non-technical evidence to understand relationships across complex data points spanning nearly five years of \nexploitation activity. The Diamond Model is an approach to analyzing network intrusion events. The model gets its \nname and shape from the four core interconnected elements that comprise any event – adversary, infrastructure, \ncapability, and victim. Thus, analyzing security incidents – from a single intrusion up to a full campaign – essentially \ninvolves piecing together the diamond using elements of information collected about these four facets to understand \nthe threat in its full and proper context over time.\n1 http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA586960Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc. (DGI)\nProject CameraShy: Introduction8\nPrevious Works\nIn April of 2012, ShadowServer initially introduced what would later be known as Naikon as an “Unknown/Unnamed” \nthreat when they shared analysis2 of commingled spear phishing lures obtained from the HardCore Charlie3 data \ndump. The Naikon APT would not achieve mainstream awareness until June 20134 when TrendMicro published a \ndetailed analysis of Naikon’s Rarstone malware. \nThe May 2014 ThreatConnect blog post “Piercing the Cow’s Tongue” – a reference to the shape of the nine-dashed \nline China uses to demarcate its territorial claims in the South China Sea – tied Naikon to the most prolific and brazen \ntargeting campaign against Southeast Asian nations.5 A year later, Kaspersky Labs published a comprehensive white \npaper detailing historic Naikon activity and key technical findings.6 Kaspersky also independently concluded the Naikon \nAPT appeared to be a dedicated and resourced effort focused on targeting Southeast Asian countries, noting Naikon \nwas responsible for an “incredible volume of attack activity around the South China Sea that has been going on since \nat least 2010.”\nWhy We Are Releasing this Analysis\nUltimately, we believe it is our responsibility to inform our global user base and bring these findings to light for public \nconsideration. ThreatConnect has demonstrated commitment to this ideal by freely sharing threat intelligence and \nproviding an industry-recognized platform in which others can aggregate, analyze, and act against common threats. \nAs the most widely adopted and comprehensive Threat Intelligence Platform on the market, we understand good \nintelligence goes beyond just tactical indicators; it must provide sufficient context to enable more informed decisions. \nTo that end, we hope this report serves as an example of the level of full-bodied threat intelligence analysis we seek to \nenable for our users and encourage within the community.\nThe ThreatConnect/DGI team acknowledges the controversial nature of such a public indictment and recognizes that \nexposing the truth is not always popular. We expect the initial reaction by some will be to condemn the messenger \nrather than the military unit responsible for the activity revealed in this report. Others will surely marginalize or question \nthe private sector’s mandate for conducting such research despite Executive Order 13691’s (Promoting Private Sector \nCybersecurity Information Sharing)7 recognition of the private sector’s obligation to share information to mitigate \ncommon risks.\nIn answering the call of EO 13691, we have carefully sought to allay innate skepticism by meeting it head-on with \ndetailed infrastructure analysis overlaid against geopolitical and “pattern of life” activities that buttress the aggregate \nbody of evidence, which cannot be muted by the staccato of official dismissals and denials to which the court of world \nopinion has become so accustomed. \nIn addition to this report, ThreatConnect has released technical indicators we have associated with Naikon activity  \nwithin the ThreatConnect Common Community, which is accessible by registering for a free account on  \nwww.threatconnect.com. It is important to note we are not claiming this is a comprehensive listing of all malware and \ninfrastructure leveraged by Naikon globally for nearly half a decade. Rather, it forms one chapter of a larger story, where \nwe look forward to enriching and expanding future collaborative research within our community of users and partners.\n2 http://blog.shadowserver.org/2012/04/16/beware-of-what-you-download-recent-purported-ceiec-document-dump-booby-trapped/\n3 https://twitter.com/HardcoreCharle\n4 http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/rarstone-found-in-targeted-attacks/\n5 http://www.threatconnect.com/news/piercing-the-cows-tongue-china-targeting-south-china-seas-nations/\n6 https://securelist.com/files/2015/05/TheNaikonAPT-MsnMM1.pdf\n7 http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-02-20/pdf/2015-03714.pdfCopyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc.

(DGI)10Key Findings\nThe Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Group commonly known within the information-security industry as \n“Naikon” is associated with the People’s Liberation Army Chengdu Military Region (MR) Second Technical \nReconnaissance Bureau (TRB) Military Unit Cover Designator (MUCD) 78020.\nThe PLA’s Chengdu MR Second TRB Military Unit \nCover Designator (MUCD) Unit 78020 (78020 部队 ) \noperates primarily out of Kunming, China with an area \nof responsibility that encompasses border regions, \nSoutheast Asia, and the South China Sea.\nAnalysis of historic command and control (C2) \ninfrastructure used consistently within Naikon malware \nfor espionage operations against Southeast Asian targets \nhas revealed a strong nexus to the city of Kunming, \ncapital of Yunnan Province in Southwestern China.\nIn eight individual cases, notable overlaps of Ge \nXing’s pattern of life activities would match patterns \nidentified within five years of greensky27.vicp.net \ninfrastructure activity.Naikon APT supports Unit 78020’s mandate to \nperform regional computer network operations, signals \nintelligence, and political analysis of the Southeast \nAsian border nations, particularly those claiming \ndisputed areas of the energy-rich South China Sea.\nThe C2 domain “greensky27.vicp.net” consistently \nappeared within unique Naikon malware, where the moniker \n“GreenSky27” is the personification of the entity who \nowns and operates the malicious domain. Further research \nshows many social media accounts with the “GreenSky27” \nusername are maintained by a PRC national named Ge Xing  \n(葛星 ), who is physically located in Kunming.\nGe Xing, a.k.a. “GreenSky27,” has been identified as a \nmember of the PLA specializing in Southeast Asian politics, \nspecifically Thailand. He is employed by Unit 78020 most \nnotably evidenced by his public academic publications and \nroutine physical access to the PLA compound. \nGreenSky27Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc.

(DGI)\nProject CameraShy: Chapter 1 – Tensions in the South China Sea and China’s Cyber Response13\n \nFigure 1: Disputed regions and exclusive economic zones within the South China Sea.\nThe littoral states have long contested the various reefs, atolls, and islands in the South China Sea. China, the \nPhilippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Taiwan all claim the disputed Spratly Islands – a string of geographic features \nrich in energy and fisheries. China’s claims are the most sweeping, with Beijing claiming most of the disputed \nSouth China Sea as sovereign territory. Confrontations between claimants have ranged from mere harassment of \ncommercial fishing and military vessels11 to deadly clashes.12,13 \nAs the Council on Foreign Relations notes, “These tensions are shaping – and being shaped by – rising \napprehensions about the growth of China’s military power and its regional intentions. China has embarked on a \nsubstantial modernization of its maritime paramilitary forces as well as naval capabilities to enforce its sovereignty \nand jurisdiction claims by force if necessary.”14 \nDominating the South China Sea is a key step for Beijing towards regional hegemony, and the other claimants are \nboth weaker and lack the security guarantees from the U.S. that have helped to temper similar tensions with Japan \nin the East China Sea.\nOver the last year, China has adopted a more aggressive posture in the region. China is increasingly deploying the \nChinese Coast Guard to enforce its claims over features in the South China Sea and operates PLA Navy vessels over \nthe horizon so they are ready to respond to escalation. China’s maritime law enforcement fleet, comprised primarily \nof Chinese Coast Guard vessels, is likely to increase in size by 25 percent and is larger than all of the other claimants \ncombined, according to the Department of Defense.15 China also relies heavily on its offensive cyber capabilities to \ngather intelligence on regional military, diplomatic, and economic intentions regarding the South China Sea. Behind \nthe scenes, China is mounting a robust computer-network exploitation campaign against claimants, and Unit 78020 \nis one of the primary players involved in the Chinese cyber response. \n11 http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2014/04/a-national-strategy-for-the-south-china-sea\n12 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq30CY9nWE8\n13 http://news.usni.org/2012/06/20/south-china-sea-history-armed-conflict\n14 http://www.cfr.org/world/armed-clash-south-china-sea/p27883\n15 The Asia-Pacific Maritime Security Strategy, p. 13. http://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/NDAA%20A-P_Maritime_SecuritY_Strategy-08142015-\n1300-FINALFORMAT.PDF.Leaflet © OpenStreetMap © CartoDBCopyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc.

In its natural state, Fiery Cross Reef is submerged at high \ntide. Between August and November 2014, Chinese dredgers created a landmass that spans the entire existing reef, \nincreasing the land area 11 times over.18\n“China insists that its landfill work is intended to provide public goods such as lighthouses, typhoon shelters for \nfishermen, weather stations, and search-and-rescue facilities,” according to The Economist .19 However, the Chinese \nhave also built a 1.9-mile-long runway capable of supporting any of China’s military aircraft, turning Fiery Cross into a \nuseful power projection platform and raising concern that China’s ultimate purpose is military in nature. In May 2015, a \nChinese admiral said Beijing could set up an air defense identification zone above disputed areas of the South China \nSea if it thought it was facing a large enough threat.20 \nAlthough the U.S. does not take an official position on ownership of the Spratly Islands, it has reiterated its commitment \nto freedom of navigation. In late May 2015, the U.S. Navy flew a surveillance mission21 around Fiery Cross Reef and \nstated its intent to continue conducting routine surveillance flights, even having the U.S. Commander of the Pacific Fleet \nAdmiral Scott Swift on one mission.22 \n16 http://amti.csis.org/environmental-aggression-in-the-south-china-sea/\n17 Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter. 30 May 2015 IISS Shangri-La Dialogue: “A Regional Security Architecture Where Everyone Rises” http://www.defense.gov/\nSpeeches/Speech.aspx?SpeechID=1945\n18 http://amti.csis.org/fiery-cross/\n19 “Asian Security: Small Reefs, Big Problems,” in The Economist, July 25, 2015. http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21659771-asian-coastguards-are-front-\nline-struggle-check-china-small-reefs-big-problems?zid=306&ah=1b164dbd43b0cb27ba0d4c3b12a5e227\n20 http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/01/world/asia/china-says-it-could-set-up-air-defense-zone-in-south-china-sea.html\n21 http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/20/politics/south-china-sea-navy-flight/\n22 http://thediplomat.com/2015/07/us-commander-joins-south-china-sea-surveillance-flight/Leaflet © OpenStreetMap © CartoDBCopyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc. (DGI)\nProject CameraShy: Chapter 1 – Tensions in the South China Sea and China’s Cyber Response15\nThe Philippines has taken a different approach by trying to use the weight of international law. Countries can claim \na 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off the coast of their mainlands and habitable islands under \nthe United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the primary source of international law on this \nsubject. The Philippines is seeking a ruling on whether China’s building on submerged reefs confers the right to \nterritorial waters and EEZs. China has refused to participate in arbitration thus far,23 claiming the tribunal does not \nhave jurisdiction. \nBeijing’s unwillingness to participate in international arbitration has not stopped it from surreptitiously monitoring \nthose interested in the case. In early July 2015, Chinese APT actors (not associated with Naikon) used an Adobe Flash \nPlayer exploit within official Permanent Court of Arbitration webpages detailing the case between the Philippines and \nChina. The exploit appeared on day three of the Netherlands-based Permanent Court of Arbitration tribunal and \naltered the webpage to load a malicious URL when visited, which would allow the adversary to exploit vulnerable web \nbrowsers and deploy a malicious payload to the victim host. The tactic of leveraging strategic website compromises \nwith patched or unpatched exploits is a well-known observable used consistently by many APT groups. Additional \ntechnical details on this attack can be found in the July 2015 ThreatConnect blog post “China Hacks the Peace \nPalace .”24 China’s efforts to target the tribunal underscore how Beijing integrates its cyber assets on a routine basis \nwith its diplomatic, political, and military initiatives. \nThe Naikon APT: Conducting Geopolitically Motivated Campaigns \nSince 2010\nKaspersky Labs, which has authored the most comprehensive introduction to the Naikon APT, describes a group \nconducting high-volume, high-profile, geopolitically motivated attacks over at least five years.25 Kaspersky assesses \nNaikon has a high success rate infiltrating national organizations in countries affiliated with the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) with early victims located mostly throughout Myanmar, Vietnam, Singapore, Laos, \nMalaysia, and the Philippines. Target profiles included high-profile government and military agencies around the \nSouth China Sea as well as state media and energy organizations both public and private. Appendix A: Naikon Oil \n& Gas-Themed Activity illustrates an example of Naikon activity likely seeking to exploit those interested in strategic \nregional energy resources.\nThe structure of Naikon operations suggests campaigns focused on individual countries, with specific toolsets deployed \nagainst a range of organizations within the designated country. To get into target networks, the Naikon APT relies on \nemail as an attack vector and precise social engineering to identify appropriate targets. Data collection prior to an attack \nhas included full names, email addresses, date of birth, interests in current events, nationality, gender, and previous \nemail and social network communications to and from a target. Kaspersky notes how the Naikon APT used a United \nNations discussion and vote on nuclear proliferation and disarmament, the missing Malaysian Airlines MH370 flight, and \nconstruction on the Raytheon-built National Coast Watch Center in the Philippines as decoy content for attacks. They \nconclude Naikon’s use of decoys that maintain regional topics of interest reveals the APT’s specific victims and how \nthey change over time more strikingly than typically seen by other malicious actors. Additional examples of Naikon’s use \nof stolen ASEAN draft talking points and classified Philippines documents can be found in the May 2014 ThreatConnect \nblog post “Piercing the Cow’s Tongue: China Targeting South China Sea Nations.”26\nThe structure of Naikon’s campaigns, nature of the targets, and reliance on precision social engineering support our \nhypothesis that the Naikon APT is PLA Unit 78020, which will be proven conclusively with technical evidence in Chapter Two.\n23 http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/will-not-recognise-international-panel-ruling-on-disputed-south-china-sea-china/\narticleshow/48071215.cms\n24 http://www.threatconnect.com/news/china-hacks-the-peace-palace-all-your-eezs-are-belong-to-us/\n25 https://securelist.com/files/2015/05/TheNaikonAPT-MsnMM1.pdf\n26 http://www.threatconnect.com/piercing-the-cows-tongue-china-targeting-south-china-seas-nations/Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc. (DGI)\nProject CameraShy: Chapter 1 – Tensions in the South China Sea and China’s Cyber Response16\nUnit 78020 and PLA Regional Cyber Operations\nEach of the PLA’s seven military regions has technical reconnaissance bureaus (TRBs), assessed to provide signals \nintelligence and cyber reconnaissance support.27 TRBs appear to be tasked with communications intelligence, \ndirection finding, traffic analysis, translation, cryptology, computer network defense, and computer network \nexploitation.\nThe Kunming TRB is one of ten military region TRBs located throughout China, and it is also known by its military unit \ncover designator (MUCD) as Unit 78020. Chinese military units are given MUCDs, five-digit numerical sequences, \nto provide basic anonymity for the unit in question and as a standardized reference. MUCDs are also used in official \npublications and on the Internet to refer to the unit in question.28 Additional information on TRBs can be found in \nAppendix B: Technical Reconnaissance Bureaus.\nIn addition to conducting network reconnaissance and computer network operations, TRBs maintain a staff of \nlinguists and regional analysts, who may be involved in traffic analysis and reporting as well as regional political, \nmilitary, and economic analysis.29 A survey of academic journal articles published by authors affiliated with Unit \n78020 include not only papers related to communications technologies, network security, cryptanalysis, and social \nnetwork analysis, but also publications on politics in Thailand and Vietnam and ASEAN science and technology \npolicy (see list of publications within Appendix C: Summary of Publications Written by Unit 78020 Personnel). \n27 Mark A.

(DGI)19\nHaving provided the backdrop of Chinese geopolitical, \nphysical, and cyber aggression in the South China \nSea region, we now turn to an in-depth, data-driven \nanalysis of one very interesting part of Unit 78020’s \nvast operational infrastructure. Our goal is to describe \nand profile the greensky27.vicp.net domain in order to \ndevelop a better understanding of the scope, structure, \nand activities of the adversary controlling it.Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc. (DGI)\nProject CameraShy: Chapter 2 – All “Naikon” Roads Lead to Kunming20\nLike other APTs, Unit 78020 leverages dynamic domain infrastructure to improve the survivability and mobility of their \ncustom malware. This allows network exploitation operators to quickly shift their C2 to new hosts without expending \ncostly resources to refit and redeploy their malware due to a hard-coded IP address.\nUnit 78020’s infrastructure maintains a notably regionalized theme, with naming conventions consistent with South \nand Southeast Asian entities under its area of responsibility. On the next page we can map clusters of Unit 78020 \ninfrastructure to their corresponding regionalized themes.\nIn addition to regionalized naming conventions, Unit 78020’s personnel have in rare instances personified or \npersonalized the infrastructure. Mandiant provided one such example in its APT 1 report revealing the “UglyGorilla” \npersona to be Unit 61398’s Wang Dong.33\nHOW DO ADVERSARIES BUILD MALICIOUS INFRASTRUCTURE?\nWe focus a lot on a particular set of adversary infrastructure in this section, but some readers may wonder \nhow such large-scale malicious networks come to be in the first place. There are many ways an adversary \ncan accomplish this. They can use infrastructure they own directly, but most adversaries know this is a \nsure-fire way to get caught. To add degrees of separation, they can buy or rent from another adversary \nor accomplice. Abusing infrastructure belonging to a legitimate and unwitting service provider is another \navenue. Many build-it-yourself options exist, most of which involve compromising hosts on the Internet in \nsome way and maintaining them over time through a combination of either legitimate remote management/\nadministration and backdoor command/control (C2) malware. \nNaikon Malware Associations\nSpecific to our current research, a member of Unit 78020 maintained the personified hostname greensky27.vicp.net \nsince 2010 or prior, during which time it has been referenced within at least eight custom malware samples. This \nsubsection does not analyze the technical intricacies of those samples. Our goal is merely to highlight the subset of \nNaikon malware families configured to communicate with the dynamic domain greensky27.vicp.net and then pivot to \nan in-depth analysis of that infrastructure.\nMALWARE MD5 HASH OBSERVED DATE NAIKON SUBVARIANT\nfb450ecb2639c0a550cec0497e95460e 07/04/2013 WinMM\nb35f2de87343a674f5c1d809a5666349 08/10/2013 WinMM\n7890eda704de4fe3f0af555c0be6ccba 08/11/2013 Wmi Inject\ne645e619856fc2e8101a4e7902120ac3 10/03/2013 SslMM\ndef6e8ad26337890eb262b8f8dd39c17 11/10/2013 SslMM\n66523a430459f284a3610c2070ca1ea7 12/27/2013 Rarstone\na2378fd84cebe4b58c372d1c9b923542 03/26/2014 WinMM\n92861d0a999591aeb72988b56d458040 07/18/2014 WininetMM\nTable 1: Observed Naikon implants that maintain greensky27.vicp.net command and control functionality.  \nNote: The highlighted hash is referenced in Figure 4.\n33 http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-05-22/uglygorilla-hacker-left-tracks-u-s-cyber-hunters-say21\nNaikon Regionalized Infrastructure\nCopyright 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc.

This decoy is in the form of a Microsoft Word document containing a Thai language \narticle and pictures from a Royal Thai Navy June 28, 2012 news release35 depicting Vietnamese fishermen detained \nfor fishing within the Thai exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The decoy content is consistent with Naikon’s practice of \nusing topical geopolitical events as bait to interact with malicious files. The primary takeaway, however, is the direct \nassociation between various instances of Naikon malware and the greensky27.vicp.net domain. With that connection \nestablished, we turn our investigation to the infrastructure behind greensky27.vicp.net.\n34 https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/7b73bf2d80a03eb477242967628da79924fbe06cc67c4dcdd2bdefccd6e0e1af/analysis/\n35 http://www3.navy.mi.th/index.php/main/detail/content_id/87Figure 4: Naikon decoy content taken from a \nJune 2012 Royal Thai Navy news release.Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc. (DGI)\nProject CameraShy: Chapter 2 – All “Naikon” Roads Lead to Kunming23\nDomain Infrastructure Analysis\nBy fusing ThreatConnect’s active DNS together with passive DNS data sets, we constructed a timeline of resolutions \nto the greensky27.vicp.net domain. Activity stretches back to September 2010 and continues up to the drafting of \nthis report in August 2015. Our records show 2,350 resolutions to almost 1,236 unique IP addresses spanning 26 \ncities and eight countries over that time frame. Figure 5 plots the scope of greensky27.vicp.net autonomous system \nnumbers (ASN) on a world map.\nFigure 5: ASNs of IPs associated with greensky27.vcip.net.\nThe physical geography is both interesting and telling. We immediately see heavy Chinese and Southeast Asian \nrepresentation, supporting our earlier statements regarding Unit 78020’s South China Sea regional focus. There are also \na few hosts in the continental U.S. that seem far from the fray but will prove to play a big role as our investigation unfolds. \nInterestingly, we see no representation from regions often synonymous with financial cybercrime and “rent-a-botnet” \nfraud schemes such as Eastern Europe.\nWe immediately see heavy Chinese and Southeast Asian representation, supporting \nour earlier statements regarding Unit 78020’s South China Sea regional focus.\nWhile Figure 5 shows physical regions of interest associated with greensky27.vicp.net, Figure 6 provides insight into \nthe roles and relationships of the underlying infrastructure. \nIMPORTANT DEFINITIONS FOR THIS SECTION\n }DNS Resolution: We use “resolution” or “resolved” in this report in reference to mappings between \na domain and an IP address. Each time DNS records show the domain resolving to a different IP \naddress, we count that as a resolution for the purposes of our analysis. We are NOT referring to \nindividual DNS requests or lookups from individual clients. To add variety, we may use generic terms \nlike “switch,” “transition,” “hop,” or “mapping” but all should be understood to refer to the same concept \nas “resolution.”\n }Resolution Duration: We use “duration” to reference the amount of time (in hours) DNS records show the domain resolved to a given IP address before changing to another.Leaflet © OpenStreetMap © CartoDBCopyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc. (DGI)\nProject CameraShy: Chapter 2 – All “Naikon” Roads Lead to Kunming24\nFigure 6: Network graph of IP address locations associated with the greensky27.vcip.net dynamic domain.\nThe network graph in Figure 6 weighs each location based upon how central it is within the greensky27.vicp.net \ninfrastructure. The dot size coincides with the number of DNS resolutions to IPs in that city. Connecting arcs show \nDNS records moving between IPs in different cities clockwise from source to destination, and the thickness of the \narc captures the relative frequency of these transitions. There are several conclusions we can draw.\n1. Nearly all roads lead to Kunming.  Of the 27 cities identified, 22 show DNS resolutions into Kunming and \n23 resolve out. No other city exhibits even half this number of connections  (Bangkok comes closest \nat 11 in and nine out). Thus, we infer that Kunming acts as a central hub or “home base” for the  \ngreensky27.vicp.net domain.\n2. Bangkok, Seoul, Hong Kong, and Denver are also important. They exhibit recurring interactions with other nodes \nin the network, albeit not as heavy as Kunming. As later analysis will demonstrate, each of these nodes serves a \nvery unique purpose within the operator’s infrastructure.\n3. There are many nodes with very few connections. Many transition only to one of the more central nodes \nmentioned above. While the network-graphing algorithm may not see them as “important,” they still serve key \nmission-specific functions. These too will be discussed later.\nKunming acts as a central hub or “home base”  for \nthe greensky27.vicp.net domain.Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc. (DGI)\nProject CameraShy: Chapter 2 – All “Naikon” Roads Lead to Kunming25\nANALYSIS OF RESOLUTION METRICS\nWe used two observable measures – the number of DNS resolutions and the duration of each resolution – to study \nthe greensky27.vicp.net infrastructure and how the adversary uses it to support their mission. Additional contextual \ninformation (e.g., geolocation, ASN) or derivative metrics (e.g., total time or hops within a city) also factor into our \nanalysis but build upon those two base metrics. Distributions specific to these measures can be found within Figures \n7 (resolutions) and 8 (durations) below.\n50% IPs used only once\n83% IPs used twice\n99% IPs used < 3 times\nMaximum usage of an\nIP: 51 times\n25% < 1 Hour\n60% < Work Day \n80% < 1 Day\n95% < 2 Days\n99% < 1 Week\nMax: 2 Months 10 DaysFigure 7: Distribution for number of resolutions per IP address.50% IPs used only once\n83% IPs used twice\n99% IPs used < 3 times\nMaximum usage of an\nIP: 51 times\n25% < 1 Hour\n60% < Work Day \n80% < 1 Day\n95% < 2 Days\n99% < 1 Week\nMax: 2 Months 10 Days\nFigure 8: Distribution of resolution durations (in hours).\n \nBoth figures point to the dynamic nature of the greensky27.vicp.net domain. In Figure 7, about half of the IP addresses \nrecorded only one resolution over the five-year time frame, and less than one percent tallied more than three. An \nextreme few racked up dozens of DNS records. Figure 8 reveals that while some resolutions persist for months, \napproximately 80 percent last less than a day. About a quarter remain bound to an IP address shorter than an hour. \nThese findings beg for further inquiry into hosts that, statistically speaking, stand out from the rest. From a network \ndefense perspective, this also reminds us of the limited utility of playing “whack-a-mole” with IPs , calling instead \nfor more effective methods of identifying, sharing, and blacklisting malicious infrastructure on the Internet.\nFrom a network defense perspective, this also reminds us of the limited utility \nof playing “whack-a-mole” with IPs , calling instead for more effective methods \nof identifying, sharing, and blacklisting malicious infrastructure on the Internet.Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc.

Kunming, home of Unit 78020, dominates \neverything, showing once again that it is the center of life, the universe, and everything  insofar as  \ngreensky27.vicp.net activity is concerned.37 \nThe adversary resolves within Kunming more often, transitions between Kunming IP addresses, spends more overall \ntime, and seemingly “owns” more infrastructure in Kunming than any other geography by far. Denver, on the other \nhand, stands a mile high above the rest in its own unique way. Denver’s single IP address boasted average durations \nmore than six times that of Kunming and more than double its next-closest competitor, Seoul. \nDenver’s single IP address boasted average durations more than six times \nthat of Kunming and more than double its next-closest competitor, Seoul. \nSeoul and Bangkok show similar profiles, except a lot more time was spent in the former. It is difficult to discern much \nabout the other cities from this view, but the next visualization fixes that.\nFigure 12 shows the proportionality for our resolution metrics relative to all cities associated with the  \ngreensky27.vicp.net domain. It provides a city-centric perspective rather than the metric-centric one seen in Figure \n11. This alleviates the Kunming predominance and lets us compare cities on more even footing. All factors being \nequal, the ratio of resolutions to IPs to duration should be roughly the same across cities. Instead, the ratios vary \ndramatically, which makes these findings very intriguing. We performed statistical significance tests on the domain \nresolution data and confirmed the apparent differences among cities to be legitimate.38 We therefore conclude these \nobservations are meaningful rather than a mirage of random variations in the data. But what, exactly, do they mean?\n36 This does not include subsequent intra-city IP hopping. We chose to omit these to better show resolution movement between cities in this figure. Otherwise,  \ntotal resolutions to Kunming IP space would literally be off the chart.\n37 Hitchiker’s Guide  fans will be interested to know it’s also home to TRB sub-unit 42 (true statement).\n38 We compared resolution metrics among cities using One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The test yielded extremely significant results with a p-value of 1.71E-19.Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc.

A high ratio of resolutions for a given location reveals levels of \naccess, control, and comfort. A cautious and wary adversary probably would not resolve into or within high-risk \nareas repeatedly over a long period of time. Instead, comparatively frequent resolutions hint at a kind of safe and \nfamiliar routine.\nA heavy skewing of unique IPs corresponds to regional investment and/or control. Having a large pool of single-use \nhosts within a region means infrastructure is easy to come by and suggests a high degree of ownership with low \nattachment to individual hosts. Conversely, locations with only one or two IPs and frequent resolutions over several \nyears indicate strategic importance and value at both the host and location levels. \nWhen the ratio of time resolved is comparably higher than the number of resolutions or unique IPs, it shows the \nadversary has the motive and means to keep the domain static for long periods of time. Chapter Four provides \nexamples of why an adversary might do this.Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc. (DGI)\nProject CameraShy: Chapter 2 – All “Naikon” Roads Lead to Kunming29\nFrom our analysis of the infrastructure behind greensky27.vicp.net, we infer three general infrastructure patterns  \nor profiles: \nLOCAL IP SWITCHING \nKunming falls squarely in this camp, with a huge number of fleeting resolutions to single-use IPs throughout the \nfive-year time frame. This suggests a deep relationship between the adversary and the city of Kunming, and it may \nalso indicate a lack of operational security or oversight. We surmise the person controlling the greensky27.vicp.net \ndomain likely lives in or near Kunming and has installed the Oray Peanut Shell client, which automatically obtains \nKunming-based IP addresses from the local service provider’s address pool when his VPN connection is not active. \nThis is not dissimilar to someone’s laptop automatically grabbing new IP addresses as they move between home, \noffice, coffee shop, etc.\nREMOTE COMMAND/CONTROL (C2)\nAnother pattern to note is brief, periodic resolutions to recurring IPs in a given location. This pattern accounts for a \nmajority of non-Chinese cities. This phenomenon is likely explained as routine intelligence collections on targets in \nthe South China Sea region. The actor connects to suborned hosts for traditional remote C2 and exits after acting \non the objective. We estimate the more hasty exits may simply be a by-product of quick connectivity checks to see \nif victims are beaconing in. Alternatively, the actor may not be experiencing favorable operational conditions. Some \nexamples include network saturation and subsequent latency or the C2 IP address being blocked, forcing the actor \nto transition to a different C2 to reacquire access to the victim implant(s).\nDOMAIN PARKING\nPatterns observed in Denver, Seoul, and non-routable (0.0.0.0) suggest \nthey are likely used when the greensky27.vicp.net domain is either offline for a given time or not interacting with routable infrastructure. \nPatterns observed in Denver, Seoul, and non-routable (0.0.0.0) suggest they are likely used when the  \ngreensky27.vicp.net domain is either offline for a given time or not interacting with routable infrastructure. They are \nthe only locations where total time resolved is disproportionately higher than unique IPs and resolutions. Seoul \nserves as a mixed bag where some of Seoul’s multiple IPs are most likely used for adversary domain parking, while \nothers appear to be traditional remote C2 hosts. Figure 13 drives this point home visually by splitting out ASNs in \nSeoul. ASN 10036 exhibits more of a C2 profile, while ASN 3786 closely mimics the parking pattern.Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc.

The \nresults showed no significant difference between the two cities, which we would expect if both truly do share similar \nprofiles. To take this one step further, we incorporated “non-routable” resolutions (which we know to be adversary \ndomain parking) into another test,40 which also found no significant differences. This provides statistical confirmation \nthat patterns in Denver and Seoul mimic parking of one form or another. So as to not offend the “it’s easy to lie with \nstatistics” crowd, we took a calculated opsec risk and (after some due precautions) simply browsed to the Denver \nIP address and greensky27.vicp.net to test this. Figure 14 is what we found. This confirmed our suspicions that \nthe greensky27.vicp.net domain will point to an IP address belonging to a Denver service provider when the user \nis logged out of the Oray Peanut Shell client. Those curious as to “why Denver?” are referred to Appendix D: Oray \nInfrastructure for further information.\n39 We used a t-test since we are comparing differences between two groups rather than three or more.\n40 Back to ANOVA this time because we have three groups: Denver, Seoul, and “non-routable.”Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc.

It shows all of the IPs that the greensky27.vcip.net \ndomain resolved to over a period of five years and brings everything we learned home in one (beautiful) shot. \nFigure 15: Network graph of all IP addresses associated with greensky27.vicp.net.\nA few nexus nodes stand out in bright contrast to the field of lesser hosts. The three profiles discussed above are \nreadily apparent. The largest dots are the parking/offline IPs of Denver, Seoul, and 0.0.0.0 i.e. not routable. The \ndense section of tiny specks in the middle is clearly the fast and fleeting local Kunming switching infrastructure. \nOther slightly larger, but still small, dots of the same color likely fall in that pattern too, but they were used a bit longer \nor more often than the pure burner IP addresses. The other small- to medium-sized, middle-layer nodes form the \ncollections infrastructure, most of which are C2 hosts located in target countries in the South China Sea region. \nThailand appears particularly prominent among C2 infrastructures in Figure 15, a fact that suggests it \nmay be the focal point of adversary collections activities.Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc.

Figure \n16 presents a stream graph for the relative percentage of time greensky27.vicp.net was bound to IPs in each city \nrespectively over the time frame of study. A possible storyline emerges from the visualization that goes something \nlike this:\nSwitching around Kunming and surrounding suburbs dominated the first two years, possibly the early days of the \nadversary’s career, mission, or the campaign itself. 2012 marks a two-year rise in foreign collection activities, focused \nlargely in Thailand and Korea. As collections dwindled (either because the mission was completed or cut short), the \nadversary increasingly parked the domain in Seoul before taking it offline with increasing regularity with a service \nprovider in Denver where it remains at the time of this writing. Whatever the correct interpretation, there is clearly an \nimportant temporal  – and perhaps human – aspect to the infrastructure worthy of further examination. To that end, \nwe will now turn to the man behind the GreenSky curtain. \nWhatever the correct interpretation, there is clearly an important temporal —  \nand perhaps human — aspect to the infrastructure worthy of further examination. \nTo that end, we will now turn to the man behind the GreenSky curtain.Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc.

First, \nGreenSky27 obliquely reveals his surname through a photo album of his visit to the Ge family’s ancestral memorial \nhall on November 23, 2013. Second, the account screen name which appears at the top of GreenSky27’s QQ Weibo \nprofile is Xing Xing ( 星星, meaning “stars”). While users are not obligated to use a real name when registering for an \naccount, the use of this name suggests GreenSky27’s real name may be similar.Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc.

Searches for GreenSky27’s QQ account number, 42113496, in \ncombination with the surname “Ge,” return a link to the website qun.594sgk.com/qq/15689281.html, which reports \nGe Xing as the owner of the account.\nGe Xing/GreenSky27’s online presence corroborates this registration information. In 2004, a user named \nGREENSKY27, located in Yunnan Province, posted a series of advertisements for model aircraft components at \nthe 5IRC.com remote control model forums. One posting included additional contact information, including the QQ \naddress 42113496 and a phone number 13608871463.42\nSearches for this QQ address and the aforementioned phone number revealed a 2014 post in a local forum  \nfor Lincang Township, a suburb of Kunming, advertising a mountain bike for sale with the point of contact  \n“Mr. Ge” ( 葛先生 ).43 This post was no longer accessible, but an image of a mountain bike in the advertisement could \nstill be accessed via a cache of Google Images.44 The bike depicted in Mr. Ge’s sales advertisement is located in the \nsame room in which other mountain bikes are shown in photos on GreenSky27’s QQ Weibo page (see Figure 21), \ncorroborating GreenSky27’s surname to be Ge.\n42 http://www.5irc.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=10476243, accessed July 3, 2015.\n43 http://lincang.gdsxxw.com/2shou/bencandy-htm-fid-52-id-28836.html, accessed July 9, 2015.\n44 Unfortunately, as of July 9, 2015, neither the image nor the original posting could be found online.Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc.

The November 21, 2012 post, from Baidu Tieba account \n“greensky27,” states: “A [child], surnamed Ge, born November 20, 2012, at 11:36PM: seeking recommendations for \na three-character name.”45 \nConfirming the Location: Ge Xing is in Kunming\nThe advertisements described above place Ge Xing in Kunming. Although his QQ Weibo account lists his physical \naddress as Ireland, numerous images uploaded to this account, including his license plate, geolocated bike routes, \nand photographs of landmarks in Kunming, place Ge Xing in Kunming.\nYUNNAN LICENSE PLATE\nThe license plate attached to Ge Xing’s car, a Volkswagen Golf, indicates a Yunnan Province ( 云南省 ) registration. The \nfollowing photo is representative of several pictures depicting the vehicle and rear plate.

These routes \nlikely were recorded using either a smartwatch or mobile phone application. The following figure shows one of these \nshared bike routes through the Wuhua District in Central Kunming.\nFigure 23: Ge Xing GPS-mapped bike ride through Central Kunming’s Wuhua District ( 五华区 ) (right).

Both profiles \nindicate residency in Kunming. The Kunming Mothers Network account was created in the “newborn infants” section \nof the website in 2012, and the photographs of GreenSky27’s newborn child posted to his QQ Weibo account \nindicate GreenSky27’s child was born the same year. The Baidu Tieba birth announcement for GreenSky27’s child \nlikewise was posted in November 2012. \nMoreover, the Lotus Street Neighborhood address given by the Kunming Mothers Network account is consistent with \nlocation information in the GreenSky27 QQ Weibo account. The image above placing GreenSky27 at the Kunming \nSchool of Public Health indicates Lotus Street Neighborhood on the right-hand side of the image, to the east of \nJiaochang Middle Road. The maps below show this location within Kunming’s Wuhua District.\nFigure 26: Location of Lotus Street Neighborhood in Wuhua District, Kunming in proximity to Unit 78020 approximately 0.42 miles.\n46 http://www.kmmama.com/home.php?mod=space&uid=7668760&do=profile, accessed July 2, 2015.Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc. (DGI)\nProject CameraShy: Chapter 3 – Meet 78020’s Ge Xing a.k.a. “GreenSky27”45\nGe Xing’s Background and Ties to Unit 78020\nGe Xing’s longstanding ties to the PLA are apparent from substantial evidence on his GreenSky27 QQ Weibo page \nand documents available on Chinese-language websites. He launched his career as a PLA officer by attending the \nPLA International Studies University in 1998. Academic papers written by Ge Xing as a graduate student specifically \nplace him at the Kunming TRB in 2008. Photos from his GreenSky27 QQ Weibo account from 2011 to 2014 place \nhim at the Kunming TRB headquarters compound, underscoring his ongoing connection with the PLA.\nATTENDANCE AT PLA INTERNATIONAL STUDIES UNIVERSITY\nGreenSky27’s QQ Weibo profile information states that he matriculated at the PLA International Studies University \n(解放军国际关系学院 ) in 1998.47,48 The PLA International Studies University was established in Nanjing in 1961, \nand the school has a long history of educating PLA officers in international strategy, military foreign relations, and \nforeign languages.49 It operates under the General Staff Department, with graduates going on to perform intelligence \ntranslation and reporting work, military liaison, or foreign language instruction at military academies.50 The university \nalso operates a branch campus in Kunming, although it is unclear whether GreenSky27 maintains any association \nwith this branch.\nATTENDANCE AT RECENT PLA EVENTS\nRecent photos posted to GreenSky27’s QQ Weibo account demonstrate his ongoing relationship with the PLA. A \nseries of photos taken in 2014 shows scenes from a PLA event commemorating the 87th anniversary of the PLA in \nKunming. The event appears to be an internal PLA exercise rather than a public event, with only a limited audience \nat an outdoor firefighting demonstration and name tags and refreshments provided at an indoor lecture.\nFigure 27: Ge Xing attends an outdoor firefighting demonstration and a lecture at a commemorative PLA event in 2014.

(DGI)\nProject CameraShy: Chapter 3 – Meet 78020’s Ge Xing a.k.a. “GreenSky27”46\nVISIT TO PLA INTERNATIONAL STUDIES UNIVERSITY IN 2014\nGreenSky27’s ties to the PLA are reinforced by a series of photos documenting his trip to the PLA International \nStudies University campus in Nanjing in 2014. The photos show exterior views of several buildings and facilities at \nthe campus. These images do not show any other people, possibly reflecting an impromptu visit by GreenSky27 to \nhis alma mater, rather than an official business tour. Two example images are shown below.\nFigure 28: Ge Xing visits PLA International Studies University in 2014.\nACADEMIC PAPERS INDICATING AFFILIATION WITH UNIT 78020 \nTwo research papers identified by searches on the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database of \nacademic journal articles directly link GreenSky27 to the Kunming TRB. These papers, both written in 2008, indicate \nauthorship by a Ge Xing ( 葛星), located in Kunming, affiliated with PLA Unit 78020. See Appendix F: Ge Xing’s Unit \n78020 Affiliated Publications for more info.\nFigure 29: Title and author information for one of the publications written by Ge Xing. The author affiliation line below the name Ge Xing ( 葛星 ) reads, \n“Chinese People’s Liberation Army Unit 78020, Yunnan, Kunming, 650223” ( 中国人民解放军 78020部队， 云南， 昆明， 650223). The title of the \narticle is “Examination of Trends in Thailand’s Southern Muslim Separatist Movement.” The publication date is December 2008.\nBoth papers discuss politics in Thailand. One paper is entitled “Analysis of Post-War Thailand’s Political \nDemocratization Characteristics and Factors” and the other “Examination of Trends in Thailand’s Southern Muslim \nSeparatist Movement.” The author biographies attached to these papers indicate that Ge Xing was born in 1980 and \nwas pursuing a Master’s degree in Southeast Asian international politics at Yunnan University ( 云南大学 ) in 2008.Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc. (DGI)\nProject CameraShy: Chapter 3 – Meet 78020’s Ge Xing a.k.a. “GreenSky27”47\nThe name Ge Xing, the author’s residency in Kunming, and the author’s affiliation with the PLA match the information \non GreenSky27’s QQ Weibo profile. From the model aircraft forum advertisements, we know that GreenSky27 has \nbeen located in the Kunming area since as early as 2004, so it is plausible he continued to reside there in 2008. The \n1980 year of birth is also consistent with what is known about GreenSky27 from his QQ Weibo profile. It is realistic \nthat a person born in 1980 would enter undergraduate studies in 1998 and become a father in 2012.\nPHOTOS PLACING GE XING AT KUNMING TRB HEADQUARTERS\nSeveral of Ge Xing’s photos from his GreenSky27 QQ account indicate he has visited Kunming TRB headquarters \nfrequently since 2011. This section leverages Ge’s photos by corroborating them with information from Chinese \nwebsites, street view imagery from QQ Maps, and satellite imagery from Google Earth. Based on his QQ account, \nGe Xing appears to have taken photographs from a hotel on base and three series of photos from the main building \non base.\nFigure 30: Unit 78020 main building and 020 Hotel outlined.Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc. (DGI)\nProject CameraShy: Chapter 3 – Meet 78020’s Ge Xing a.k.a. “GreenSky27”48\nPhotos from Hotel 020 Parking Lot on Base\nOn December 16, 2013, Ge posted photos from his visit to the 020 Hotel (0 二0宾馆 ), a guest house ( 招待所 ) for \nPLA Unit 78020.51 According to Chinese websites, this guest house is located at 158 Jiaochang East Road, Wuhua \nDistrict, Kunming ( 云南省昆明市五华区教场东路158号 ), near Kunming General Hospital (25°04’23.2”N 102°42’08.9”E \n25.073126, 102.702467).52 This is the same address identified by Western analysts as the headquarters building for \nUnit 78020.53\nFigure 31: Ge Xing’s photos of his car parked at the 020 Hotel, posted to the GreenSky27 account.\nFor this address, QQ Maps censors parts of the entrance and certain individuals in its Streetview. From a vantage \npoint farther away and zoomed in, however, the entrance’s features include a red star over the entrance and \ncharacters beyond the entrance that are too far to make out.\nFigure 32: QQ Streetview imagery of the security entrance to the Unit 78020 compound. The image to the left had been censored within QQ, whereas \nthe image to right was not.\nBased on this information we can place Ge Xing in the compound at the hotel. Ge’s vantage point is the parking lot \nfacing towards the gate, showing a slanted wall, a reddish gate, and Chinese characters and blue rectangular panels \nfor the Kunming General Hospital.\n51 http://kunming.youbian.com/huangye/info74049/, accessed July 9, 2015.\n52 Ibid.\n53 Mark A.

(DGI)\nProject CameraShy: Chapter 3 – Meet 78020’s Ge Xing a.k.a. “GreenSky27”50\nPhotos Taken from the Kunming TRB Main Building\nBased on Ge’s QQ account, he took photos from at least three different vantage points near the Kunming TRB’s main \nbuilding, outlined in the figure above. First is a series of four photos of a tall building with a distinctive roof ornament, \ntaken near a basketball court. Second are photos of a parking lot from within the compound with a distinctive tower \nin the background. Finally, Ge’s QQ account includes a photo of a courtyard from within the compound.\nThe building from which these photos appear to have been taken is not labeled in open source media, but it stands \nout as the central structure within the compound. The numerous communications dishes arrayed on its rooftop are \nconsistent with our assessment that it is the Kunming TRB headquarters building.\nFigure 34: Overview of Unit 78020’s main compound with landmarks and likely vantage points of photos posted to social media.Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc. (DGI)\nProject CameraShy: Chapter 3 – Meet 78020’s Ge Xing a.k.a. “GreenSky27”51\nPhotos of Building with Distinctive Roof Ornament\nFour images depicting a tall apartment complex topped with a distinctive roof ornament appear to have been taken \nfrom the same location over a period spanning from November 2011 to March 2013. All four of Ge Xing’s photos appear \nto have been taken and uploaded at about 8:30 AM on different dates. Regarding the vantage point, one of the images \n(the first in the sequence above) depicts a basketball hoop and backboard in the foreground, part of a basketball court \nthat is no longer maintained and adjacent to a central building within the Kunming TRB headquarters compound.\nFigure 35: Photos from within Unit 78020 of a tall building with a distinctive roof ornament (left).

(DGI)\nProject CameraShy: Chapter 3 – Meet 78020’s Ge Xing a.k.a. “GreenSky27”52\nParking Lot and a Structure Resembling a Water Tower\nAnother series of photos sharing a similar vantage point appears to depict a parking lot and several nearby locations \nwithin the Kunming TRB compound. These photos appear to have been taken between March and December 2013 \nfrom within the central building in the Kunming TRB compound. In Google Earth and on QQ Streetview, there is a \nstructure shaped like a water tower that matches the structure on the right side of Ge Xing’s photos.\nFigure 36: Photos from within Unit 78020 of the parking areas with background landmark of a water tower (bottom three images).

(DGI)\nProject CameraShy: Chapter 3 – Meet 78020’s Ge Xing a.k.a. “GreenSky27”53\nCourtyard Within the Kunming TRB Compound\nOn September 3, 2013, Ge Xing took a photo of a courtyard, the pattern of which matches the two courtyards in the \nmiddle of the main building for the Kunming TRB.\nFigure 37: Photo from within Unit 78020’s main compound courtyard.\nIn short, the totality of evidence from online Chinese media confirms both GreenSky27’s identity as Ge Xing and \nGe’s affiliation with PLA Unit 78020. Online social media accounts, geolocated trips and photos, and references \nto a physical address confirm Ge Xing’s identity and location in Kunming. Ge’s military, academic, and publication \nbackground strongly hint at his PLA responsibilities, and his photos at the Kunming TRB’s main building itself provide \ndefinitive proof of association.\nWe hypothesize Ge Xing is a staff officer at 78020 providing regional expertise to a team of technical personnel. He \nis qualified for such a role with his apparent expertise in Thai politics, evidenced by his Master’s degree in Southeast \nAsian politics and relevant publications. Ge likely has a position within at least the middle level of the PLA professional \nhierarchy based on his academic credentials, 10-15 years of experience within the PLA, and his occasional travel \nto Beijing, Chengdu, and Nanjing. Apart from the appearance of his screen name within Naikon’s C2 infrastructure, \nthere is no indication of technical training. Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc.

This section documents how Ge Xing’s \nbackground is ideal for supporting Naikon activities and \nhow his personal schedule correlates with activity by \ngreensky27.vicp.net. To confirm the greensky27.vcip.net \ndomain was not the work of a freelancer, we examined the \ntime of day during which the domain made DNS record \nchanges. We also found striking correlations when we \noverlaid Ge Xing’s social media postings with periods of \ngreensky27.vcip.net domain inactivity.Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc. (DGI)\nProject CameraShy: Chapter 4 – No Room for Coincidence-Evidence of Ge Xing and 78020’s Involvement in Naikon Activities56\nThe most compelling evidence of Ge Xing’s involvement with Unit 78020 and the Naikon campaigns is the correlation \nbetween details of his personal-life events such as travel, vacation, family events, and Naikon activity. We base our \ntimelines of Ge’s personal life and events on his QQ photos taken across the country, as well as comments made on \nthose photos and other social media. Trip dates are based on the posting dates for photos Ge took in a particular \nlocation. When Ge Xing is away from Kunming, analysis of the greensky27.vicp.net infrastructure indicates it is offline \nor parked as detailed in Chapter Two. As we dive into passive and active DNS resolutions for the greensky27.vicp.net \ndomain over the past five years, we can identify notable resolution patterns that are consistent with events, dates, \nand times Ge has posted online.\nTo give you a bird’s-eye view of the timeline of events in the greensky27.vcip.net domain history and Ge Xing’s \npersonal-life events over the last five years, we present to you Figure 38 below.\n0510152025\n020040060080010001200\nOct\n2010Jan\n2011Apr\n2011Jul 2011 Oct\n2011Jan\n2012Apr\n2012Jul 2012 Oct\n2012Jan\n2013Apr\n2013Jul 2013 Oct\n2013Jan\n2014Apr\n2014Jul 2014 Oct\n2014Jan\n2015Apr\n2015Jul 2015\nTimelineSum of Unique IPsResolutionsSum of Unique IPs\nResolutions\nFigure 38: Timeline of infrastructure activity and adversary-relevant events.\nThe red line denotes the number of times the greensky27.vcip.net domain changed IP addresses in a day.

A glimpse of the chart gives you four distinct time periods: heavy activity from late October \n2010 to July 2011, followed by a more or less dormant period until October 2011. The domain resumed high operational \ntempo until June 2014, after which we see extended periods of dormancy with occasional bursts of activity.\nThe blue line shows the cumulative rise in number of unique IP addresses the domain has resolved to over the five-\nyear period. There is a clear correlation between the red and blue lines: whenever the domain is dormant (absence \nof activity on the red line), you see the blue line flattening (no rise in usage of new IP addresses) and conversely a \nsteady increase in the blue line whenever the domain is highly active.\nThe vertical lines represent certain “pattern of life” events tied to Ge Xing and show a remarkable correlation with the \ntimeline of the greensky27.vcip.net domain infrastructure. But don’t squint too hard, we are going to dive deep into \neach of the events.Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc.

The graphs below provide a zoomed-in timeline around the Chinese New Year events of 2011 (the Year \nof the Rabbit), 2012 (the Dragon), and 2013 (the Snake). As expected, the domain is dormant for almost a whole \nweek in each of the three cases, the length of time an individual may be expected to be on leave during this event. \nBy July 2014, the domain remained consistently dormant, so the 2014 and 2015 Chinese New Year events showed \nnothing irregular. \n00.511.522.533.54\n115120125130135140145150155\n23 Jan3 0 Jan0 6 Feb1 3 Feb2 0 Feb 27 Feb0 6 Ma r1 3 Mar\nTimelineSum of Unique IPsResolutionsSum of Unique IPs\nResolutions\nFigure 39: Infrastructure activity around Chinese New Year 2011 (Thursday, February 3).\n00.511.522.533.544.55\n400410420430440450460470\n15 Jan 22 Jan2 9 Jan0 5 Feb1 2 Feb 19 Feb2 6 Feb0 4 Mar\nTimelineSum of Unique IPsResolutionsSum of Unique IPs\nResolutions\nFigure 40: Infrastructure activity around Chinese New Year 2012 (Monday, January 23). \n0123456789\n810820830840850860\n03 Feb1 0 Feb1 7 Feb2 4 Feb0 3 Mar1 0 Mar1 7 Ma r2 4 Mar\nTimelineSum of Unique IPsResolutionsSum of Unique IPs\nResolutions\nFigure 41: Infrastructure activity around Chinese New Year 2013 (Sunday, February 10).\n54  http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/17/travel/china-spring-migration-chunyun/Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc. (DGI)\nProject CameraShy: Chapter 4 – No Room for Coincidence-Evidence of Ge Xing and 78020’s Involvement in Naikon Activities58\nOf these three examples, 2012 is of particular interest. Chinese New Year was celebrated on January 23, 2012. We \nsaw the expected lull in activity, but it was cut short. On Friday, January 27, 2012 at 10:55 AM China Central Time, \nthe greensky27.vicp.net domain reactivated, making resolution changes until Thursday, February 2 and then going \ninactive again over the weekend before resuming activity on Monday, February 6, 2012.\nOur working hypothesis is the holiday may have been interrupted by news of the bilateral U.S.-Philippines negotiating \nbroader military cooperation. On January 26 and 27, 2012, Western media outlets such as the New York Times55, \nReuters56, and Time Magazine57 reported on a high-level Philippine delegation visiting Washington, D.C. The visit \nwas part of preliminary talks with U.S. officials aimed at strengthening military cooperation in support of the Obama \nadministration’s strategic “pivot” to Asia. We suspect reports of the Philippine delegation’s visit to Washington may \nhave interrupted New Year festivities and forced resumption of active work.\nWe acknowledge dormancy during the Chinese New Year holiday does not on its own prove the person behind the \ngreensky27.vcip.net infrastructure is Ge Xing specifically, since practically the entire country takes vacation during \nthis time. To further prove that out, we plotted certain events in Ge Xing’s life from his social media postings as \ndescribed in Chapter Three, which correlate closely to lulls in activity within our timeline.\nBeijing Resolutions Coincide with a February 2012 Visit to the Capital\n00.511.522.533.544.55\n400410420430440450460470\n15 Jan 22 Jan2 9 Jan0 5 Feb1 2 Feb 19 Feb2 6 Feb0 4 Mar\nTimelineSum of Unique IPsResolutionsSum of Unique IPs\nResolutions\nFigure 42: Infrastructure activity around Ge Xing’s Febuary 2012 visit to Beijing.

(DGI)\nProject CameraShy: Chapter 4 – No Room for Coincidence-Evidence of Ge Xing and 78020’s Involvement in Naikon Activities59\nShortly after the Chinese New Year, Ge Xing visited Beijing from February 12 to 16, 2012, shown in a red \nvertical band in the figure above. We suspect the visit was official business, during which we observed the  \ngreensky27.vcip.net domain resolve to an IP address in Beijing. Of the nearly 2,500 DNS record changes in our entire \ndata set, less than half of one percent ever resolved into a Beijing IP address – a third of which fell within this time \nperiod. The rarity of the domain in question resolving to Beijing combined with the corresponding visit by Ge Xing \nprevents us from accepting this as mere coincidence. \nBirth Announcement for Ge Xing’s Child: November 2012\nA November 21, 2012 post on Baidu Tieba by “greensky27” states: “A [child], surnamed Ge, born November 20, \n2012, at 11:36 PM: seeking recommendations for a three-character name.”58 The public post was made to four forum \nthreads within Baidu Tieba at roughly the same time.

These images show the exterior of \na memorial hall devoted to remembrance of the Ge family’s deceased ancestors, as well as individual tablets and \ninscriptions within the hall bearing the Ge family name. The figures below show several of these images accompanied \nby translations. The QQ Weibo caption common to all of these photos reads, “Returning home to pay respect to the \nancestors, this ancestral memorial hall is not bad.”\nFigure 46: Plaque and memorial within the Ge family memorial hall. The heading on the plaque at left reads, “Ge family ancestral hall epitaphs” ( 葛氏宗\n祠碑誌 ). The inscription on the memorial at right reads, “Memorial to Ge family past generations and deceased parents” ( 葛氏歷代宗祖考妣之神位 ).\nInfrastructure analysis of greensky27.vicp.net highlights Ge was active using infrastructure from Kunming and \nThailand for the week prior to his weekend trip to his ancestral hall on November 23, 2013. However on November \n23, the greensky27.vicp.net infrastructure was inactive, parked in Seoul and Denver. Note the gap is only 28 hours, \nso the infrastructure was active on both of the calendar days with a gap of 28 hours between them.

Overall, however, the domain was active from October 2010 to May \n2014 with an increasing cumulative number of unique IP addresses associated. The blue line in Figure 51 illustrates \nthis trend with a drastic flat-lining starting in late May 2014. This notable decline in the rate of unique IP addresses \nresolved is accompanied by an overall drop in activity.\n02468101214161820\n112011401160118012001220\nMar\n2014Apr\n2014May\n2014Jun\n2014Jul 2014A ug\n2014Sep\n2014Oct\n2014Nov\n2014Dec\n2014Jan\n2015Feb\n2015 TimelineSum of Unique IPsResolutionsSum of Unique IPs\nResolutions\nFigure 51: Infrastructure activity before and after May 19, 2014. \nOne possible theory for this stark change is the May 19, 2014 indictments59 that the U.S. Department of Justice levied \nagainst five Chinese military officers within Unit 61398. On that same date, ThreatConnect published a blog post “Piercing \nthe Cow’s Tongue: China Targeting South China Sea Nations” which detailed Naikon activity.\n59 http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-five-chinese-military-hackers-cyber-espionage-against-us-corporations-and-laborCopyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc. (DGI)\nProject CameraShy: Chapter 4 – No Room for Coincidence-Evidence of Ge Xing and 78020’s Involvement in Naikon Activities63\nGe Xing’s Workday\nAnother interesting set of observations can be made by studying the time of day during which the greensky27.vcip.net \ndomain made DNS record changes. One possible counterargument to our case is the person operating the domain \nis a freelancer. However, the distribution of the DNS record changes shown in Figure 52 strongly suggests a normal \nworkday. Times are shown in China Standard Time (CST), the time zone used in Kunming. This distribution is a very \ngood indicator of the work hours (+0800 Kunming time) that Ge likely keeps. For example, we can see a spike of activity \naround 9:00 AM with a mid-day break in activity for lunch, where Ge likely ends his day at various times in early evening \nbetween 6:00 and 8:00 PM. The mean of the distribution falls around noon, and it would seem that a substantial portion \nof the data falls inside 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.60 \nHour of Day in Chinese Standar d Time (CST)5 00\n15 10 20 2550100150200250Number of Resolutions\nFigure 52: Total count of resolution activity by hour of day (China Standard Time) between 2010 and 2015.\nLooking at time of day data for other key cities such as Bangkok, Denver, and Seoul reinforces our conclusions about \ntheir role in the adversary’s network. As discussed earlier, Ge Xing’s academic background focused on Thailand. \nBangkok is the second-most resolved city with a high number of resolutions but low time spent resolved. The \ntimes are concentrated during the workday and appear centered on the morning work hours. A possible scenario \nis Ge arrives at work around 9:00 AM, establishes a VPN tunnel into Naikon’s operational remote C2 infrastructure, \nupdating his Oray Peanut Shell client manually or setting it to automatically resolve to the respective Bangkok C2 IP \naddress, the same geography where his targets are most likely located. \n60 The unusual propensity for earlier times before 9:00 AM is due to a series of resolutions into Kunming in 2010 and 2011. During these years, Ge made very few \nresolutions after 10:00 AM. Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc.

(DGI)65\nCAMERASHY\nConclusionCopyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc. (DGI)\nProject CameraShy: Conclusions66\nChina’s incremental yet determined march into the South China Sea is clearly underway. These overt efforts \nby multiple pillars of Chinese national power are an outward manifestation of their intent to influence and \ncontrol regional interests. However, operations occurring in the shadows are equally important to what we see \nconventionally. All of China’s activities in the South China Sea, whether military, diplomatic, or economic, have been \nlong supported by a well-resourced covert signals intelligence and digital exploitation unit that maintained deep \naccess within China’s Southeast Asian neighbors’ public and private sector enterprises.\nChina’s justification in leveraging the military grade signals intelligence Unit 78020 for these operations goes far \nbeyond exploiting countless enterprise networks to acquire proprietary data. Unit 78020’s network intrusions are \njust a ways to a means, and the greensky27.vcip.net infrastructure analyzed in this report is just one small cog in the \nmachine. What is really at hand is a broader national objective of physically intruding into the 1.4 million square miles \nthat make up the South China Sea. It is likely that China does not view this behavior as criminal in nature, insofar as \nit cannot be stealing if you already consider something to be yours. But the targets of this activity most certainly do \nnot share that view. \nThis aggressiveness clearly comes at an expense to China’s reputation regionally and internationally as credible proof \nof these operations continues to mount. As this report adds its testimony to the trial, we expect – and have already \nseen – a temporary cessation in greensky27.vcip.net activity and broader Naikon activities. What we do not expect to \nsee is any change in policy, rhetoric, or operations; China will undoubtedly continue their routine of blasé denials and \ndismissals of all allegations. Such a position becomes harder to maintain, however, when one of their own – albeit \nunwittingly – offers the incriminating evidence. We hope the evidences revealed in this report serve as a catalyst for \ngreater awareness and improved diplomacy within the South China Sea region and around the globe.\nTakeaways for Intelligence Analysts\nWhile the big picture of this report addresses regional and international affairs, our intent is to speak at a more tactical \nlevel to the technical analysts who read it. A love of analysis is not only at the core of our DNA as a company, but has \ndeep personal roots as well. We enjoyed doing this analysis and hope that shows in the final product.\nOur goal with this report is to demonstrate the merits of a comprehensive approach to intelligence that strongly \nconnects knowledge about an adversary with their capabilities, infrastructure, and target victims. In that sense, the \ngreensky27.vcip.net domain merely serves as a convenient example to make that case; we realize it’s only a small \nshard in the tip of the Naikon iceberg. There are many public instances of single-dimensional analysis gone wrong, \nand we offer the structure and rigor of pivoting around the Diamond Model for Intrusion Analysis as a counter to that. \nAnother takeaway for analysts, especially those newer to the field, is how a relatively small set of initial indicators can \n(with the right platform and processes) be developed into a much larger body of intelligence.\nAnother takeaway for analysts, especially those newer to the field, is how \na relatively small set of initial indicators can (with the right platform and \nprocesses) be developed into a much larger body of intelligence. \nWe began this analysis from a few open source reports and one domain referenced in a handful of malware samples. \nAnd that brings up another key takeaway. The principles of science hold that useful research must be shared and \nreproducible so that findings can be vetted by peers to advance the knowledge of the community. Those same \nprinciples apply to threat research, and we commend all of you who hold to them. \nFinally, if you enjoyed reading about this analysis, why not participate in expanding and enriching it?

But that does not mean it has no relevance to those living \n“in the trenches” who have the difficult job of defending enterprise networks day in and day out. Intelligence that is \nnever operationalized is arguably not intelligence at all. \nWith respect to operational defensive efforts, the aim of this analysis is to showcase possibilities enabled through a \nbroad collection of human and technical intelligence. As stated in Chapter Two, we see limited value in the endless \ngame of IP whack-a-mole. Half of all IPs tied to greensky27.vcip.net were seen only once and a quarter of them \nremained active for less than an hour. A much more efficient approach lies in creating diverse sets of associated \nindicators along with established tactics, techniques, and procedures and leveraging smart automation to enable \nthem holistically through all layers of defense.\nA much more efficient approach lies in creating diverse sets of associated \nindicators along with established tactics, techniques, and procedures and \nleveraging smart automation to enable them holistically through all layers \nof defense.\nOn that note, we believe defensive “layers” matter. When approaching the task of stopping badness in your network, \nmany potential options exist. Some are inherently more efficient than others. As one example, the ability to block an \nentire domain like greensky27.vcip.net as malicious at the DNS layer is much more effective and much less effort than \nendless firewall rule changes to deny thousands of associated IPs added daily from all over the world.\nUnit 78020’s tactic of leveraging current regional events in combination with malicious decoy documents demonstrates \nthat attacks against hardware and software often target wetware first. So, it’s key to defend at the human level first \nand foremost. See this as an opportunity to educate all staff to recognize and respond to suspicious activity, files, and \nincidents. Knowing that they target the vulnerable user over the vulnerable asset is especially critical during periods of \nincreased tensions, diplomatic summits, or other events of strategic interest to potential state or state-affiliated actors.\nTakeaways for Business Leaders\nLast but certainly not least, we’d like to offer some parting thoughts to the executives, decision makers, and managers \nwho invested their time to review this report – or to those who will brief them. ;) \nThe inherent unfairness of the security game should be plainly obvious from the scope of this investigation. Those \nwho still picture the adversary as hoodie-wearing teens crouched over a computer in their mom’s basement are \ndoing their organizations a disservice. In many cases, as evidenced in this document, the adversary thinks well \nbeyond even your “long-term” strategic plan and is far better resourced than your entire organization. That is not \nmeant as an insult, merely as fact to make the point that your security teams need consistent support from the top \nto help level the playing field. Giving them that support in combination with sufficient resources to do their job is the \nmost important thing you can do to minimize risk to your organization.\nRelated to that, understanding the complex array of industry, regional, and international dynamics at play is critical to \nproperly assessing that risk. We hope this report demonstrates that the likelihood of being targeted may not merely be \na function of the sensitivity of your intellectual property. There are many socioeconomic and geopolitical factors that \ndrive exploitation campaigns, their impact to victim organizations, and far beyond. Savvy leaders will make every effort \nto understand these factors in light of their business and take steps to mitigate them as best as possible. It would be \ndisingenuous of us not to recommend solid threat intelligence products like DGI’s BLUE HERON, PassiveTotal’s passive \nDNS dataset, and powerful platforms like ThreatConnect as ways to help accomplish that.Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc.

(DGI)78\nAPPENDIX D:  \nOray Infrastructure\nOverview of how Ge Xing \nabuses Oray dynamic DNS \ninfrastructure.\nVICTIMS\nCAPABILITIESINFRASTRUCTURE\nADVERSARY\nCopyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc. (DGI)\nProject CameraShy: Appendix D – Oray Infrastructure79\nIn Chapter Two we delved into detail covering the various patterns observed with the dynamic greensky27.vicp.\nnet domain. For those less familiar with this type of infrastructure, it is important to understand the purpose of a \ndynamic domain, the service provider in which the domain is managed, and how the user (in this case Ge Xing) likely \nmanages the dynamic domain and the associated resolution records.\nAs we mentioned in Chapter Two, Naikon and online threat actors in general leverage and abuse benign dynamic \nDNS service providers to obtain affordable means for mobility and redundancy to communicate with their malicious \ncode. The technique is quite simple: the adversary chooses a dynamic DNS service provider of interest and registers \nfor an account. The adversary will create a hostname (greensky27), binding it to one of the service providers domains \nin which the dynamic DNS services are offered (vicp.net). The domain (greensky27.vicp.net) is then bound to the user \naccount under the adversary’s control. \nExample of a the Oray Peanut Shell Client.\nThe attacker will then embed the new dynamic domain (or domains) within \na malicious payload of their choice, in advance of the targeting or delivery \nphase of the attack. Once the malware is deployed and a victim interacts \nwith it, the malicious payload calls home to the dynamic domain, resolving \nand connecting to the respective C2 IP address the attacker chooses. The \nattacker maintains the ability to update DNS records, pointing it to \ninfrastructure (IP addresses) at any time and place of their choosing. In the \ncase of Oray DNS records can be updated manually or managed with client \napplications or embedded devices such as SOHO routers. Oray boasts \nintegrations with a variety of embedded hardware vendors such as D-Link, \nTP-Link, ZTE, Huawei, and Cisco.66\nIn the use case highlighted above, Ge and the Naikon APT in general opt to \nuse Shanghai Best Oray Information Technology Co., Ltd. ( 上海贝锐信息科技\n有限公司 ) as a dynamic domain infrastructure service provider. In fact, Naikon \neven makes a casual reference to Oray within their self-registered domains \nsuch as oraydns.googlesec.pw.67 \nAccording to its website, Oray provides online services and software \napplications. Its  “Peanut Shell” ( 花生壳 ) services and applications include \nremote desktop control ( 远程监控 ), website and forum maintenance, VPN \nservices, email systems, FTP services, and office automation services.68 \nUsers do not need to update their dynamic DNS service through a browser. \nInstead, Oray offers a local client application that allows users to manage the domain and update items such as the \nA record, MX record, CNAME (alias), and URL redirection.69 \nAccording to several Oray.net forum posting notifications to its free Peanut Shell dynamic domain service customers \nand support forum posts, Oray uses the 174.128.255.0/24 IP address range for resolution of offline ( 离线) domains \nwhere the registered user’s host or router is not logged into the dynamic domain service70. This is an example of \n“provider parking” as opposed to the Seoul or non-routable resolutions, which we assess as “adversary parking.”\n66 http://hsk.oray.com/embed/\n67 https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/69953/the-naikon-apt/\n68 http://hsk.oray.com.\n69 http://open.oray.com/wiki-en/doku.php \n70 http://bbs.oray.com/thread-226666-1-1.htmlCopyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc.
