    "text": "El Machete's Malware\nAttacks Cut Through LATAM\nThreatVector  > Research & Intelligence\nShare It:\n by The Cylance Threat Research Team  | March 22, 2017\nExecutive Summary\nThe SPEAR™ Team has once again jumped back into tracking and monitoring threats following\npublic disclosure, to discover what happens next. What we’ve found is that the current barrier\nto bypass existing defense solutions is so low that attackers need only make very minor\nchanges to continue to use publicly disclosed malware effectively. El Machete is one of these\nthreats that was first publicly disclosed and named by Kaspersky here . We’ve found that this\ngroup has continued to operate successfully, predominantly in Latin America, since 2014. All\nattackers simply moved to new C2 infrastructure, based largely around dynamic DNS domains,\nin addition to making minimal changes to the malware in order to evade signature-based\ndetection.\nSPEAR was able to identify just over three hundred unique victims over the past month, as\nwell as over 100GB worth of data that was exfiltrated and stored on one of the C2 servers.\nThe bulk of the victims were predominantly based out of Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, Argentina,\nand Columbia; however, other victims were identified in Korea, the United States, the\nDominican Republic, Cuba, Bolivia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Mexico, England, Canada, Germany,\nRussia, and Ukraine. Targets included a wide array of high-profile entities, including intelligence\nservices, military, utility providers (telecommunications and power), embassies, and government\ninstitutions.\nPerhaps what’s most interesting in the current dataset is that the majority of countries that\nwere most heavily targeted share a land border with Brazil. However, SPEAR did not identify\nany Brazilian victims, contrary to Kaspersky’s initial findings.\nFindings\nPhishing emails continued to use links to external ZIP or RAR archives, which ultimately\ncontained an executable with the extension SCR. All of the executables SPEAR identified\ncontained either an executable generated by the open source Nullsoft Scriptable Install\nSystem ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/ ) or a self-extracting RAR executable (SFX). NSIS\nprovides a surprisingly easy way for attackers to obfuscate malicious code via multiple common\ncompression routines like ZLib, BZip2, LZMA. The attackers also made extensive use of\nHostinger’s cheap web hosting services to deliver initial payloads. SPEAR identified the\nfollowing URLs were used in phishing attempts:\nhxxp://actualizacion.esy[dot]es/Mision_Secreta_de_la_DINA_en_Washigton.rar\nhxxp://almuerzowordaula3.16mb[dot]com/ORDENES_GENERALES.rar\nhxxp://carolinaz25.esy[dot]es/DECRETO_No_18_Duelo_Virgilio_Godoy_.rar\nhxxp://carolinaz25.esy[dot]es/RDGMA_07_4432.rar\nhxxp://cristianoo.esy[dot]es/Padrino_Lopez_Hay_un_golpe_de_Estado_en_desarrollo.zip\nhxxp://cristianoo.esy[dot]es/ROSARIO_EN_MULTINOTICIAS_13_ABRIL_2016.zip\nhxxp://flipjbl.esy[dot]es/Suport/Articulo%20sobre%20funcionarias%20de%20Nicaragua%20docx.rar\nhxxp://flipjbl.esy[dot]es/Suport/Debes%20utilizar%20una%20computadora%20para%20extraer%20el%20contenido.rar\nhxxp://informesanddocumentos.esy[dot]es/semanario_en_marcha_1758_1.zip\nSPEAR observed the following filenames were used for malicious payloads delivered via social\nengineering techniques:\nPayload Filenames:\n977_REG_IN_CO_012_V1.scr\nAniversario_de_cascos_azules_ecuatorianos.docx.scr\nArticulo sobre funcionarias de Nicaragua docx.scr\nArticulo_de_Opinion_Heinz_Dieterich.docx.scr\nBoletín_PAT_034_UADMNE_Visita_de_Guardianes_del_Mar_a_repartos_navales.scr\nCitacion Judicial expediente 10388-17 Oficio 35467pdf.scr\nCIRCULAR_8_OCT_2016.scr\nCuestionario.scr\nDECRETO_No_18_Duelo_Virgilio_Godoy_.docx.scr\nDemanda.scr\nDenuncia_penal_o_querella.scr\nDIRECTIVA_MANDO_OPERACIONAL.scr\nInforme Derechos Humanos en Nicaragua docx.scr\nINSTRUCTIVO LOGISTICO.scr\nJungmann verifica o funcionamento do SISFRON, em Dourados (MS).docx.scr\nLISTA DEL RADG N° 0931208.scr\nMinisterio_de_Defensa_ordena_al_Issfa_que_no_suspenda_tres_prestaciones.scr\nMision_Secreta_de_la_DINA_en_Washigton.scr\nNicaragua denuncia ante la CIJ las.scr\nNotificacion_Judicial_No_121523_2015.scr\nNotificacion_Judicial_No_121523_2016.scr\nNotificacion_Judicial_No_8030923_2015.exe\nORDENES_GENERALES.scr\nPadrino_Lopez_Hay_un_golpe_de_Estado_en_desarrollo.scr\nPARTE ESPECIAL COMANDANCIA GENERAL DE LA AVIACIÓN 20SEP15.scr\nRDGMA_07_4432.scr\nREINCORPORACION.SCR\nROSARIO_EN_MULTINOTICIAS_13_ABRIL_2016.scr\nSemanario_En_Marcha_1756_11.scr\nThe group still preferred to use PY2EXE  to encode Python scripts to executables and relied on\nmultiple compiled scripts to perform a number of different functions, including screen capture,\nvideo capture, audio capture, file enumeration, keystroke logging, and data exfiltration. As far as\nSPEAR could tell, all scripts were designed to be executed using Python v2.7. No other versions\nof the interpreter were identified. The group relied heavily on TLS-encrypted FTP using\nPython’s native ftplib library to transfer data out of target environments. SPEAR only observed\nthis activity over the usual TCP port 21. The samples would also test connectivity to the C2 via\nHTTP requests using Python’s urllib library. An example request is shown below.\nGET / HTTP/1.0\nHost: idrt.gotdns.ch\nUser-Agent: Python-urllib/1.17\nFigure 1: Sample Connectivity Request\nThe scripts themselves could be easily extracted and decompiled out of the binaries using\nuncompyle . The decompiled scripts employed some visual obfuscation techniques by naming\nvariables as combinations of the characters ‘o’, ‘O’, and ‘0’ to hinder analysis. One of the\nexternal modules was designed to find, encrypt, and upload files from fixed and removable\ndrives using a predefined list of extensions; perhaps most interesting in this list was the\ninclusion of several graphical information systems file formats (GIS), as well as PGP/ GPG files\nand private key rings. In-depth analysis of the scripts showed the group employed AES in CBC\nmode using a predefined static key to encrypt files before uploading them to the C2 server.\nSeveral simple obfuscation measures, including various XOR encoding schemes, were employed\nby the malware to obscure configuration files, which was somewhat surprising given the use of\nstronger encryption used in exfiltration of important data.\nThe attackers appeared to prefer to use free dynamic DNS domains that provided No-IP  or\nCommand and Control (C2). SPEAR discovered the following domains and IP addresses were\nused continuously over the past two years:\nDomains:\nderte.ddns[dot]net\nidrt.gotdns[dot]ch\njristr.hopto[dot]org\nwbgs.3utilities[dot]com\nIP Addresses:\n176.9.3.184\n213.239.232.149\n69.64.43.33\nThe domain ‘jristr.hopto[dot]org’ shared a direct link to past El Machete activity via the IP\naddress ‘181.50.98.50’, which was also previously used by ‘java.serveblog[dot]net’.\nPersistence:\nSPEAR found that El Machete relied on two primary means to achieve persistence: scheduled\ntasks and the startup folder. Scheduled tasks commonly used ‘HD_Audio’, ‘Java_Upda’, or\n‘Microsoft_up’ as the task name and generally pointed to one of the executables below:\n%AppData%\\Desjr\\jfxrt.exe\n%AppData%\\unijr\\kfxw.exe\n%AppData%\\MicroDes\\javaH.exe\nThe path ‘%UserProfile%\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\Java Update.lnk’ was used in one\nsample in 2015. ‘HD Audio.lnk’ was observed as a possible value in one of the decompiled\nscripts, however, the Startup Folder technique seems to have been largely abandoned in later\nsamples, perhaps as a result of disclosure.\nFile-based Indicators:\nThe group preferred to create their own directories to drop files into, including:\n%AppData%\\unijr\\\n%AppData%\\HDA\\Bush\\\n%AppData%\\jre8\\lib\\\n%AppData%\\java.\\\n%AppData%\\MicroDes\\\nFor the sake of brevity, SPEAR has excluded all of the possible file names, but they should be\nreadily accessible via the hashes provided below. The principal droppers were commonly SFX\narchives and were typically named either ‘jsx.scr’ or ‘RAVBg.scr’. Defenders should be wary of\nany script interpreters such as ‘python27.dll’ located in unusual directories.\nConclusion:\nEl Machete has continued largely unimpeded in their espionage activities for the past several\nyears, despite the abundance of publicly available indicators. Many of these indicators should\nhave allowed defenders to reliably identify this threat, but the majority of antivirus (AV)\nsolutions continue to have very low detection rates across current samples. Compiled scripts\nare an increasingly complicated area of detection for security companies and will likely\ncontinue to be adopted by both skilled and unskilled attackers alike. Scripting languages\nnatively provide an easy means of developing cross platform compatibility for other operating\nsystems like OSX and Linux, however, all of the scripts SPEAR found appeared to be heavily\nreliant upon Windows APIs to perform critical functions.\nEl Machete will no doubt continue to be successful across most Latin American countries as\nthey struggle to build up both their offensive and defensive cyber capabilities. Many of the\ntargeted countries were listed as customers in the leaks of both Finfisher and Hacking Team,\nwhich suggests they likely have yet to fully mature and develop their own internal cyber\ncapabilities. In any case, whoever is behind El Machete is certainly reaping the rewards of\nbuilding and deploying their own custom malware.\nIf you use our endpoint protection product, CylancePROTECT® , you were already protected\nfrom this attack .
