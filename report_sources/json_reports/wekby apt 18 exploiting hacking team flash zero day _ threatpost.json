Labels found in the code, in fact,\nrefer to Hacking Team, the company said.\nInternal emails, sales invoices and other documents leaked since the breach was made\npublic implicate Hacking Team in selling exploits and intrusion software to oppressive\ngovernments and sanctioned countries .\nThe spear phishing message found by Volexity urges the victim to download and install an\nupdated version of Flash and includes a link to http://get[.]adobe[.]com that instead redirects\nthe recipient to a site hosted by PEG TECH Inc. The site loads a malicious .swf file exploiting\nthe Flash vulnerability patched yesterday by Adobe.\nThe malware executes and connects to a known Webky command and control address\nhosted in Singapore, Volexity said.\n“Any connection involving this IP address or these hostnames should be consider hostile and\na likely indicator of compromise,” the company said in its report .\nIn the past, the Webky APT group, also known as APT 18, has hosted other malware families\nfrom the Singapore IP address, including Poison Ivy and the Gh0st remote access Trojan in\nthis case.\nVolexity said that current, patched versions of Flash will display a pop-up dialog with the\nword “faile!” prominently displayed.\n“It looks like the attackers may have left a debug message from their testing,” Volexity said.\n“Not very subtle at all.\n“The attackers are having a field day with this exploit and will not slow down any time soon,”\nthe company said. “Patching is the most prudent course of action to deal with this exploit\nthat is very much in the wild.”\nAdobe yesterday patched the zero day in Flash Player , CVE-2015-5119, one of 36\nvulnerabilities patched in the update. The Hacking Team bug was the only one being publicly\nexploited. The update patched a mix of vulnerability classes, including memory address\nrandomization issues, heap buffer overflows, memory corruption bugs, security bypass\nvulnerabilities, same-origin bypasses, and use-after-free flaws.\nThe Flash zero day, it was revealed yesterday as well, was quickly integrated into the major\nexploit kits , including Angler, Nuclear and Neutrino, as well as the Metasploit Framework.\nSecurity company Bromium, published its analysis  of the zero day, determining it was a byte\narray use-after-free memory issue that allows an attacker to gain control of a Windows\nmachine running the vulnerable Flash Player. Researcher Nick Cano wrote that Hacking\nTeam built its proof-of-concept code based on a 2014 vulnerability known as the\nActionScript-Spray attack (CVE-2014-0322) which took advantage of a UAF bug in Internet\nExplorer to gain access to the heap of a process.\nMeanwhile, yesterday, Department of Homeland Security’s CERT at the Software\nEngineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University released an advisory  warning users about\na still unpatched Windows kernel vulnerability that was also part of the Hacking Team data\ndump.\nThe flaw lives specifically in the Adobe Type Manager kernel module in Windows ; the\nmodule provides support for OpenType fonts.\n“A memory-corruption flaw in Adobe Type Manager allows for manipulation of Windows\nkernel memory, which can result in a wide range of impacts,” said the CERT advisory. In this\ncase, a successful exploit such as Hacking Team’s could allow an attacker to bypass browser\nand operating system sandbox protection to obtain System privileges on a Windows\ncomputer.\n“We have confirmed that the exploit code successfully obtains SYSTEM privileges on\nWindows XP through Windows 8.1 systems, both 32-bit and 64-bit,” CERT said.\nShare this article:\nHacks\n Malware\n Vulnerabilities\n Web Security\nCoronavirus-Themed APT\nAttack Spreads Malware\nThe APT group was spotted sending\nspear-phishing emails that purport to\ndetail information about coronavirus –\nbut they actually infect victims with a\ncustom RAT.\nMarch 13, 2020\nSpear-Phishing Attack Lures\nVictims With ‘HIV Results’\nAttackers are purporting to send victims\nHIV test results – but in reality are\nconvincing them to download the\nKoadic RAT.\nMarch 10, 2020\nMicrosoft Exchange Server\nFlaw Exploited in APT Attacks\nA vulnerability is Microsoft Exchange\nservers is being actively exploited by\nmultiple APT groups, researchers warn.\nMarch 9, 2020\nA Practical Guide to Zero-Trust\nSecurity\nJanuary 15, 2020  2\n7 Tips for Maximizing Your SOC\nDecember 31, 2019  5\nMean Time to Hardening: The Next-\nGen Security Metric\nDecember 30, 2019  4\nCombining AI and Playbooks to\nPredict Cyberattacks\nDecember 26, 2019  1\nThe Case for Cyber-Risk Prospectuses\nDecember 24, 2019  1\nNewsletter\nSubscribe to Threatpost Today  \nJoin thousands of people who receive the\nlatest breaking cybersecurity news every day.\nSubscribe now\nTwitter\nAs the threat of \ncontinues to spread, businesses are\nsending employees home to work\nremotely - But wit… \n28 mins ago\nFollow @threatpost\n#coronavirus\nhttps://t.co/DCvZKitL4D\nThe First Stop For Security News Home\n About Us\n Contact Us\n Advertise With Us\n RSS FeedsCopyright © 2020 Threatpost Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Advertise\nBlack Hat Breaking News Cloud Security Critical Infrastructure Cryptography Facebook\nSUGGESTED ARTICLES\nDISCUSSIONINFOSEC INSIDER\nSubscribe to our newsletter, Threatpost Today !
