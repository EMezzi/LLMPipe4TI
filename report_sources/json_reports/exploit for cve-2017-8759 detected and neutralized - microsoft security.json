    "text": " \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nThe September 12, 2017 security updates from Microsoft  include the patch for a previously unknown\nvulnerability exploited through Microsoft Word as an entry vector. Customers using Microsoft advanced\nthreat solutions were already protected against this threat.\nThe vulnerability, classified as CVE‐2017‐8759 , was used in limited targeted attacks and reported to us by\nour partner, FireEye. Microsoft would like to thank FireEye for responsibly reporting this vulnerability  and\nfor working with us to protect customers.\nCustomers receiving automatic updates for Microsoft products are protected from this attack without\nany additional action required. Customers not enjoying the benefits of automatic updates should\nconsider immediately applying this month’s updates to avoid unnecessary exposure.\nOffice 365 ATP and Windows Defender\nATP customers protected\nCustomers running Microsoft advanced threat solutions such as Office 365  Advanced Threat Protection\nor Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection  were safe from this attack without the need of\nadditional updates. The security configuration and reduced attack surface of Windows 10 S  blocks this\nattack by default.\nOffice 365  ATP blocked the malicious attachments automatically in customer environments that have\nadopted the mail detonation and filtering solution. The attachment was blocked based on the detection\nof the malicious behaviors, as well as its similarity with previous exploits. SecOps personnel would see an\nATP behavioral detection in Office 365 ’s Threat Explorer page:\nFigure 1. Block reasons for the exploit attachment as seen in Office 365 ATP console\nWindows Defender ATP  was also able to raise multiple alerts related to post‐exploitation activities\nperformed by this exploit using scripting engines and PowerShell. Additional alerts may also be visible for\nsubsequent stages of the attack performed after malware installation.\nTo test how Windows Defender ATP can help your organization detect, investigate, and respond to\nadvanced attacks, sign up for a free trial .\nIn addition, Windows Defender Antivirus  detects and blocks exploits for this vulnerability as\nExploit:RTF/Fitipol.A, Behavior:Win32/Fitipol.A, and Exploit:RTF/CVE‐2017‐8759.A using the cloud\nprotection service, which delivers near‐real‐time protection against such never‐before‐seen threats.\nFigure 2. Windows Defender ATP alerts raised for CVE‐2017‐8759 zero‐day exploit\nProtection with Windows Defender\nExploit Guard\nWe are also happy to share with customers testing our upcoming Windows 10 Fall Creators Update that\nWindows Defender Exploit Guard  was also able to prevent this attack using one of the many Attack\nSurface Reduction rules and exploit protection features.\nFigure 3. Example of exploit blocking event logged by Windows Defender Exploit Guard\nWindows Defender Exploit Guard  is part of the defense‐in‐depth protection in the Windows 10 Fall\nCreators Update  release.\nAnother zero‐day leading to FinFisher\nThe CVE‐2017‐8759  vulnerability can allow remote code execution after users open a spam email, and\ndouble‐click on an untrusted attachment and disable the Microsoft Office Protected View  mode. The\nexploit uses Microsoft Word as the initial vector to reach the real vulnerable component, which is not\nrelated to Microsoft Office and which is responsible for certain SOAP‐rendering functionalities through\n.NET classes.\nFor more information on this new campaign our partner FireEye has a good technical blog  describing the\ninfection mechanism and the details of the exploit.\nAfter the initial notification from FireEye, Windows Defender telemetry revealed very limited usage of this\nzero‐day exploit. The attacker used this exploit to deploy a spyware detected as Wingbird  and also\nknown to the security community as “ FinFisher ”, a commercial surveillance package often seen combined\nwith expensive zero‐day vulnerabilities and used by sophisticated actors.\nMicrosoft researchers believe that the adversary involved in this operation could be linked to the\nNEODYMIUM group , which has used similar zero‐day exploits with spear‐phishing attachments combined\nwith the usage of FinFisher spyware. We previously reported about the NEODYMIUM group in the\nWindows Security blog  in 2016. For additional information about this new attack as well as other\nNEODYMIUM attacks, we encourage Windows Defender ATP customers to review the in‐product Threat\nIntelligence reports on this activity group.\nTo test how Windows Defender ATP can help your organization detect, investigate, and respond to\nadvanced attacks, sign up for a free trial .\n \n \nElia Florio\nWindows Defender ATP Research Team\n \n \nRelated blog posts\nOffice 365  Advanced Threat Protection defense for corporate networks against recent Office exploit\nattacks\nTwin zero‐day attacks: PROMETHIUM and NEODYMIUM target individuals in Europe\n \n \n \n \nTalk to us\nQuestions, concerns, or insights on this story?
