The incident remains classified, the official said.\nRye Brook Mayor Paul Rosenberg said the dam is used to control water flow when it rains to\nprevent flooding downstream. The dam is managed by a piece of software that Rosenberg told\nCNN was \"industry standard\" and \"very common.\"\nHe said he doubted the hackers could have wreaked heavy damage or that Rye was a\nsubstantial target, but it worries him that hackers are looking for any opportunity they can find\nto cause damage.\nRELATED: Obama signs cybersecurity bill\n\"I think one of the great things here is that the federal government stepped in and stopped\nwhat could have been something bad from happening,\" Rosenberg said. \"We appreciate that,\nbut it makes me wonder about what would be potentially next, and that makes me concerned. I\nthink in this day and age all municipalities needs to look at our infrastructure and see where are\nour soft targets, where should we be prepared.\"\nNews of the attack illustrates what has long been a fear of cyber experts: that overseas hackers\ncan easily get into pieces of old critical infrastructure running on retro-fitted software that is\nconnected to the Internet. U.S. susceptibility to an attack on its electrical grid or industrial\ncontrol systems by terrorists or other nations has been a concern of security experts,\nlawmakers and academics alike.\nHackers are often able to use tools to scan the Internet for networks that are vulnerable, and\ngeneric software makes that even easier. Software used across many different entities can\noften have the same weaknesses and may not be kept up to date, and users sometimes keep\nin place default passwords and settings for convenience.\nTo make matters worse, most of the critical infrastructure in the U.S. is privately owned, making\nit difficult for governments to harden the systems against attack.\nThe news also comes on the heels of another major breach -- a flaw in software from computer\nnetwork company Juniper Networks that would have allowed sophisticated hackers to install\nbackdoors into computer networks potentially allowing them to spy on the encrypted\ncommunications of the U.S. government and private companies for the past three years.\nRELATED: Hack has U.S fearing foreign infiltration\nThe Department of Homeland Security would not comment on the dam intrusion, but did note in\na statement that its cybersecurity center serves as a hub for monitoring and mitigating to\nattacks. DHS also maintains the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team\n(ICS-CERT) to respond to such attacks.\n\"The Department of Homeland Security continues to coordinate national efforts to strengthen\nthe security and resilience of critical infrastructure, working with our federal and industry\npartners across the country to raise awareness about evolving threats and promote measures\nto reduce risks to systems we all rely on,\" the department said.\nNew York lawmakers cited the news as an example of the need for greater attention on\ncybersecurity.\n\"Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism around the globe, so this sort of behavior is par for\nthe course. An Iranian cyber-attack on a small dam in Rye is reason enough for concern, but\nwhen we look at other potential targets ... it's clear that we must do more to assess and\naddress potential vulnerabilities to a cyberattack,\" Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel said in a\nstatement.\n\"Reports of Iranian hackers infiltrating the control system of a Rye dam in 2013 underscore the\nurgent need for a national cybersecurity strategy that protects individuals, businesses, and our\ncommunities,\" said Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey. \"I will continue working to ensure Iran -- the\nnumber one state-sponsor of terrorism -- is held accountable for its actions, and that my\nconstituents in Westchester and Rockland, as well as all Americans, can live in safe and secure\ncommunities.\"\nAccording to ICS-CERT , in 2014 the team responded to 245 cyber incidents reported by critical\ninfrastructure operators, 32% of which were in the energy sector and 27% of which were in\ncritical manufacturing.\nMany of the compromises were carried about by simple \"spearphishing\" attacks -- where\nemployees are duped into clicking a malicious link by an email.\nCNN's Rene Marsh contributed to this report.\nFollow @CNNpolitics\nPAID CONTENT\nEcco il Cronografo Acquistato Dagli\nUomini Di Successo - 59€…\nSponsored: Tecnologia Per Tutti\nSe investissi solo 200€ sui titoli\nAmazon, potresti essere milionario…\nSponsored: INVESTI ORA\n[Pics] School expels teen over outfit,\nregrets it when they see who dad is\nSponsored: RLIDiscover the Most Extravagant\nHomes in Los Angeles\nSponsored: Mansion GlobalWorld’s Most Dangerous Travel\nSelfies\nSponsored: Far and Wide\nHealth\nCoronavirus vaccine trial\nadministers first dose to…Politics\nJohn King: Trump 'deliberately'\nusing offensive term for…\nCNN International - Videos\nDana White on coronavirus: 'I've\nnever seen anything like this in\nmy…CNN International - TV - Videos\nTrump shifts tone on coronavirus\ncrisis as U.S. cases increaseBusiness\nAs coronavirus suspends life in\nAmerica, Fox changes its tone\nEllen DeGeneres and Portia de\nRossi Pay $3.6 Million For Antique…\nSponsored: Mansion GlobalLo sbaglio più grosso che\ncommettiamo assicurando l'auto\nSponsored: Car Insurance | Sponsored Listings\nAzioni Amazon: Bastano solo 200€\nper Ottenere un Secondo Stipendio\nFisso!\nSponsored: Investi nel Migliore: AmazonJulia Roberts Spends $8.3M on a\nCentury-Old San Francisco Victorian\nSponsored: Mansion GlobalIl costo delle auto ibride potrebbe\nsorprenderti\nSponsored: Auto Ibride - Link Sponsorizzati\nPAID CONTENT MORE FROM CNN\nEcco il Cronografo Acquistato Dagli Uomini Di Successo\n- 59€…  Tecnologia Per Tutti\nTi occupi di ecommerce?
