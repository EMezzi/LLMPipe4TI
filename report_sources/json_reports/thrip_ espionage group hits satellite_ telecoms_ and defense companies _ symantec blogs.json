Click for details.\n\nCritical Attack\nDiscovery and\nIntelligence Team\nSymantec\n\n\n SUBSCRIBE\nThrip: Espionage Group Hits Satellite,\nTelecoms, and Defense Companies\nSymantec’s artificial-intelligence-based Targeted Attack Analytics uncovers new\nwide-ranging espionage operation.\nOne of the most significant developments in cyber espionage in recent years has been the number of groups adopting\n“living off the land ” tactics. That’s our shorthand for the use of operating system features or legitimate network\nadministration tools to compromise victims’ networks. The purpose of living off the land is twofold. By using such\nfeatures and tools, attackers are hoping to blend in on the victim’s network and hide their activity in a sea of legitimate\nprocesses. Secondly, even if malicious activity involving these tools is detected, it can make it harder to attribute attacks.\nIf everyone is using similar tools, it’s more difficult to distinguish one group from another. Most attack groups do still\ncreate and leverage custom malware, but it tends to be employed sparingly, reducing the risk of discovery.\nFinding the needle in the haystack\nThis doesn’t mean espionage attacks are now going undiscovered, but it does mean that they can take longer for\nanalysts to investigate. This is one of the reasons why Symantec created Targeted Attack Analytics (TAA) , which takes\ntools and capabilities that we’ve developed for our own analysts and makes them available to our Advanced Threat\nProtection (ATP) customers. TAA leverages advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning that combs through\nSymantec’s data lake of telemetry in order to spot patterns associated with targeted attacks. Its advanced AI automates\nwhat previously would have taken thousands of hours of analyst time. This makes it far easier for us, and for our\ncustomers, to find that “needle in the haystack.”\nIt was TAA that led us to the latest cyber espionage campaign we’ve uncovered. Back in January 2018, TAA triggered an\nalert at a large telecoms operator in Southeast Asia. An attacker was using PsExec to move laterally between computers\non the company’s network. PsExec is a Microsoft Sysinternals tool for executing processes on other systems and is one\nof the most frequently seen legitimate pieces of software used by attackers attempting to live off the land. However, it’s\nalso widely used for legitimate purposes, meaning malicious use of PsExec can be difficult to spot.\nTAA not only flagged this malicious use of PsExec, it also told us what the attackers were using it for. They were\nattempting to remotely install a previously unknown piece of malware ( Infostealer.Catchamas ) on computers within the\nvictim’s network.\nFigure 1. Targeted Attack Analytics leverages machine learning to spot malicious activity\nassociated with targeted attacks and alerts the customer.\nArmed with this information about the malware and living off the land tactics being used by this group of attackers\nwhom we named Thrip, we broadened our search to see if we could find similar patterns that indicated Thrip had been\ntargeting other organizations. We uncovered a wide-ranging cyber espionage campaign involving powerful malware\nbeing used against targets that are a cause for concern.\nWe identified three computers in China being used to launch the Thrip attacks. Thrip’s motive is likely espionage and its\ntargets include those in the communications, geospatial imaging, and defense sectors, both in the United States and\nSoutheast Asia.\nEye on the sky: Thrip’s targets\nPerhaps the most worrying discovery we made was that Thrip had targeted a satellite communications operator. The\nattack group seemed to be particularly interested in the operational side of the company, looking for and infecting\ncomputers running software that monitors and controls satellites. This suggests to us that Thrip’s motives go beyond\nspying and may also include disruption.\nAnother target was an organization involved in geospatial imaging and mapping. Again, Thrip seemed to be mainly\ninterested in the operational side of the company. It targeted computers running MapXtreme Geographic Information\nSystem (GIS) software which is used for tasks such as developing custom geospatial applications or integrating location-\nbased data into other applications. It also targeted machines running Google Earth Server and Garmin imaging software.\nThe satellite operator wasn’t the only communications target Thrip was interested in. The group had also targeted three\ndifferent telecoms operators, all based in Southeast Asia. In all cases, based on the nature of the computers infected by\nThrip, it appeared that the telecoms companies themselves and not their customers were the targets of these attacks.\nIn addition, there was a fourth target of interest, a defense contractor.\nFigure 2. Thrip, spying on communications, mapping, and defense targets\nAttempting to hide in plain sight\nThrip uses a mixture of custom malware and living off the land tools to perform its attacks. The latter include:\nPsExec : Microsoft Sysinternals tool for executing processes on other systems. The tool was primarily used by the\nattackers to move laterally on the victim’s network.\nPowerShell:  Microsoft scripting tool that was used to run commands to download payloads, traverse compromised\nnetworks, and carry out reconnaissance.\nMimikatz:  Freely available tool capable of changing privileges, exporting security certificates, and recovering\nWindows passwords in plaintext.\nWinSCP:  Open source FTP client used to exfiltrate data from targeted organizations.\nLogMeIn:  Cloud-based remote access software. It’s unclear whether the attackers gained unauthorized access to\nthe victim’s LogMeIn accounts or whether they created their own.\nAll of these tools, with the exception of Mimikatz (which is almost always used maliciously), have legitimate uses. For\nexample, PowerShell is widely used within enterprises and the vast majority of scripts are legitimate. Similarly, PsExec is\nfrequently used by systems administrators. However, in this case, it was Thrip’s use of PsExec that drew our attention.\nThrough advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning, TAA has trained itself to spot patterns of malicious\nactivity. While PsExec itself may be innocuous, the way that it was being used here triggered an alert by TAA. In short,\nThrip’s attempts at camouflage blew its cover.\nWhile Thrip now makes heavy use of living off the land tactics, it also employs custom malware ( Infostealer.Catchamas ),\nparticularly against computers of interest. Catchamas is a custom Trojan designed to steal information from an infected\ncomputer and contains additional features designed to avoid detection.\nHighly targeted espionage operation\nFrom the initial alert triggered by TAA, we were able to follow a trail that eventually enabled us to see the bigger picture\nof a cyber espionage campaign originating from computers within China and targeting multiple organizations in the U.S.\nand Southeast Asia. Espionage is the group’s likely motive but given its interest in compromising operational systems, it\ncould also adopt a more aggressive, disruptive stance should it choose to do so.\nProtection\nThe following protections are in place to protect customers against Thrip attacks:\nFile-based protection\nInfostealer.Catchamas\nHacktool.Mimikatz\nNetwork protection products\nMalware Analysis Appliance detects activity associated with Thrip\nCustomers with Webpulse-enabled products are protected against activity associated with Thrip\nThreat intelligence\nIn addition to file-based protection, customers of the DeepSight Intelligence Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence\n(MATI) service have received reports on Thrip, which detail methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this group.\nFile Attachments\nFurther reading\nTo find out more about Targeted Attack Analytics (TAA), read our whitepaper Targeted Attack Analytics: Using Cloud-\nbased Artificial Intelligence for Enterprise-Focused Advanced Threat ProtectionSHAREPOSTED: 19 JUN, 2018 5 MIN READ THREAT INTELLIGENCE\nThrip IOC list TXT 564 bytes\nAbout the Author\nBlogs Threat Intelligence/ Menu\n "
