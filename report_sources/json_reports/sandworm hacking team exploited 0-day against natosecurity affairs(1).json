The\nresearchers at ISight dubbed the hacking group SandWorm because of references discovered in its\ncode to the science-fiction novel “Dune.”\nThe experts at iSIGHT Partners have worked in close collaboration with Microsoft during the\ninvestigation, the company announced the discovery of a zero-day  vulnerability affecting all\nsupported versions of Microsoft Windows and Windows Server 2008 and 2012. The vulnerability has\nbeen classified with the code CVE-2014-4114, and according the revelation made by iSIGHT is has\nbeen exploited  in cyber espionage operation on a large scale by a Russia hacking team, the nature of\nthe target and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) adopted lead the experts to believe that\nthis is the work of state-sponsored hackers.\n“This is consistent with espionage activity,” said iSight Senior Director Stephen Ward. “All indicators from a\ntargeting and lures perspective would indicate espionage with Russian national interests.”\nMicrosoft is already working on a security update for the CVE-2014-4114 that will be available in the\nnext patch updates on the October 14th.\nAccording to the report issued by iSIGHT, the APT has been active since at least 2009, Its targets in the\nrecent campaign also included a Polish energy firm, a Western European government agency and also\na French telecommunications firm.\niSIGHT_Partners sandworm timeline_13oct2014\nThe experts began the investigation in late 2013 when the NATO alliance was targeted by\nthe SandWorm hacking team with exploits other than the zero-day, but they discovered the critical\nzero-day   in August, when the group targeted the Ukrainian government, in the lead-up to the NATO\nsummit in Wales.\n“In late August, while tracking the Sandworm Team, iSIGHT discovered a spear-phishing  campaign targeting the\nUkrainian government and at least one United States organization. Notably, these spear-phishing attacks\ncoincided with the NATO summit on Ukraine held in Wales.” states the report published by iSIGHT .\nSecurity experts speculated that the intensification of the cyber dispute  between Russian and\nUkraine  could have increased the likelihood to discover operations that went under the radar for so\nlong.\nBelow chronological details provided by the researchers on the Sandworm activity:\nThe NATO alliance was targeted as early as December 2013 with exploits other than the zero-day\nGlobSec attendees were targeted in May of 2014 with exploits other than the zero-day\nJune 2014\nBroad targeting against a specific Western European government\nTargeting of a Polish energy firm using CVE-2013-3906\nTargeting of a French telecommunications firm using a BlackEnergy variant configured with a Base64-\nencoded reference to the firm\nThe SandWorm hacking team sent spear-phishing emails with a malicious attachments to compromise\nthe victim’s machine, the threat actors mentioned a global security forum on Russia and a purported\nlist of Russian terrorists.\nAnother element that suggests Russia is responsible for the cyber espionage  campaign are codes\ndiscovered on  the C&C server, located in Germany, that had not been properly secured and that\ncontains Russian-language computer files that had been uploaded by the hackers.\n“They could have closed it off, and they didn’t,” he said of the server. “It was poor operational security.”\nThe investigators noticed that SandWorm apparently re-engineered malware previously by other APT\nprobably to masquerade its campaigns.\nRead the full post for further information .\nPierluigi Paganini\n(Security Affairs  –  Sandworm , cyber espionage)\nAPT CVE-2014-4114 cyber espionage Cybercrime Hacking NATO Russia Sandworm\nUkraine zero-Day\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKEShare this...\n\n\nPREVIOUS ARTICLE\nReflected File Download attack to spread\n0-Day Worm Over Any Social Networks\n NEXT ARTICLE\n7 million DropBox credentials apparently\nleaked \n\n "
