The same campaign has also \ntargeted key Philippine military agencies. Though \nthe motivations behind the operation are still unclear, the tools and tactics used reveal potential areas of weakness both countries should look into.Operation Tropic Trooper took advantage of two of \nthe most-exploited Windows® vulnerabilities to date—\nCVE-2010-3333 and CVE-2012-0158—to infiltrate their chosen networks. Part of its success could be \nattributed to the use of basic steganography or image \nfile attachments laced with malicious code, combined with clever social engineering.\nThis research paper provides in-depth technical \ninformation on Operation Tropic Trooper’s targets, components, tools, and tactics.\n*\n* Special thanks to Ronnie Giagone for additional \nanalyses and insights.Operation Tropic Trooper Research Paper1 | Page © 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\nTargets\nMalware used in Operation Tropic Trooper shared similar characteristics \nwith those used in attacks targeting various organizations in Vietnam and \nIndia as early as 2011. [1]\nOperation Tropic Trooper targets government institutions, military \nagencies, and companies in the heavy industry in Taiwan and the \nPhilippines. [2]\nOperation Tropic Trooper campaign flow\nOperation Tropic Trooper Research Paper2 | Page © 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\nCampaign \nComponents\nPoint of Entry\nThe actors behind Operation \nTropic Trooper used spear-\nphishing emails with weaponized \nattachments to exploit old vulnerabilities, particularly CVE-2010-3333 and CVE-2012-\n0158. \n[3–5] These bugs have \nbeen two of the most exploited vulnerabilities since their \ndiscovery. \n[6–7]\nTo infiltrate target networks, the attackers relied on crafty social \nengineering tricks. They used \ncontextually relevant subjects, content, and aptly named attachments such as “Statement” to convince chosen recipients to download and open the files supposedly sent for review.\nThe following filenames were also used:\n• 3AD 28 March 2013, SI re ASG Plan Bombing in Zamboanga \nCity.doc\n• Troops Disposition 26 FEB 13.doc\n• 2nd qtr 2013 AR PF15.doc\n• Draft AS-PH MLSA - v3 DAGTS_CFO_ILOG_DSA Clean.doc\n• 關於104年中央政府總預算.doc (translation: About 104 years total \ncentral government budget.doc)\n• 實驗室電話表.doc (translation: Laboratory telephone table.doc)\nSpear-phishing email sample3 | Page © 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\n• [REDACTED]自荐信及个人简历.doc \n(translation: [REDACTED] cover letter and \nyour resume.doc)\nOpening the attachment runs an embedded malicious executable file, normally a downloader that accesses \na malicious site to download an image file. Some attachments open decoy documents to hide their malicious nature.\nInitial Payload: TROJ_YAHOYAH\nThe downloader typically attached to emails related to Operation Tropic Trooper is detected by Trend Micro \nas TROJ_YAHOYAH, a downloader with 32- and 64-\nbit support. It has an encrypted configuration file and uses HTTP GET requests to download other files that are then decrypted and executed in memory.\nSample decoy documents (left: for Filipino targets; right: \nfor Taiwanese targets)Installation Routine\nWhen executed, TROJ_YAHOYAH checks if the \ninfected system’s Windows OS is 64-bit capable or \nnot. If it is, the Trojan will decrypt a 64-bit copy of itself \nusing a simple XOR cipher with a single-byte key at “0x90.”\nIf the infected system \nis not 64-bit capable, the Trojan will just drop \na 32-bit executable \ncopy of itself (%APP DATA%\\Microsoft\\\nCredentials\\Credentials.\nexe, detected as TROJ_YAHOYAH), along with an encrypted \nconfiguration file \n(%APP DATA%\\Microsoft\\Credentials\\Credentials.dat). The \nconfiguration file was encrypted using the same simple algorithm \nfeatured in the \npreviously cited Rapid7 report on KeyBoy. Unlike the KeyBoy Trojan though, which searches \nfor the string, “IJUDHSDJFKJDE,” TROJ_YAHOYAH \nsearches for “MDDEFGEGETGIZ.” These strings, \nfound at the beginning of the decrypted code, represent the configuration file. Absence of the said \nfile terminates the infection process.\nCode that decrypts the \nconfiguration file using “0x95,0x99,0x9d,0xc3,0xc7,  \n0xcb,0xd7,0xe5,0xbd,0xa9,  \n0xb5,0xeb,0xf7,0xe3,0xe7,  \n0xed” as key4 | Page © 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\nTROJ_YAHOYAH’s configuration file, when \ndecrypted, contains the links to sites from which it can \ndownload the files it needs to continue its routines. \nAfter decryption, it executes a dropped copy using the -Embedding parameter then attempts to delete itself.\nThe downloader’s name was inspired by its self-deletion routine after dropping its payload. YAHOYAH was derived from the Visayan term “hayohay,” which \nloosely translates to an easily discarded “servant” in \nEnglish. \n[8]\nDownload Routine\nTROJ_YAHOYAH attempts to access links and download files via HTTP GET requests. To move to \nanother attack phase, it uses the following user-agent \nstrings:\n• MSIE: Checks for the system’s Internet Explorer® version\n• NT: Checks for the system’s Windows OS version\n• AV: Checks for installed antimalware solutions\n• OV: Checks for the system’s Microsoft™ Office® version\nTROJ_YAHOYAH’s decrypted configuration file• NA: Checks for the system’s hostname\n• VR: Hard-coded string only used when accessing download sites to track which downloader was used on a target.\nTROJ_YAHOYAH checks for the following antimalware solution processes:\n• 360rp.exe\n• 360tray.exe\n• ALMon.exe\n• ALsvc.exe\n• ashserv.exe\n• Avastsvc.exe\n• avgam.exe\n• avguard.exe\n• avp.exe\n• avpmapp.exe\n• consctl.exe\n• CyberoamClient.exe\n• econceal.exe\n• econser.exe\n• ekrn.exe\n• escanmon.exe\nHTTP GET request sample5 | Page © 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\n• mcshield.exe\n• nod32krn.exe\n• pccntmon.exe\n• rtvscan.exe\n• SAVAdminService.exe\n• SavService.exe\n• sfctlcom.exe\n• swi_service.exe\n• uiwatchdog.exe\nTROJ_YAHOYAH temporarily saves downloaded files \nin a specially created folder named “%APP DATA%\\\ntasks\\up{random characters}.msi.”\nSample .MSI file with a malicious .JPG headerThe image is supposed to be an 800 x 600 wallpaper \nthat is way heavier than the real one named “Wind.\njpg” normally found in Windows XP systems’ %WINDOWS%\\wallpaper\\web folder. The actors \nbehind Operation Tropic Trooper may be using a simple steganography technique to mask the \nbackdoor’s routines in order to evade antimalware \nand network perimeter detection. \n[9] We have seen \nthe actors use other images found in the same folder \nsuch as “Ascent.jpg,” “Friend.jpg,” and “Home.jpg.”\nSample .MSI file opened on Microsoft Paint6 | Page © 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\nMaintaining Persistence\nThe last file that TROJ_YAHOYAH executes in \nmemory is the main installer. It contains two more files \nthat install a .DLL file detected as TROJ_YAHAMAM. \nThis file is registered as a service named “INCS” to \nmaintain persistence. It also drops the following XOR-encrypted malware-laced image files:\n• % windows %\\System32\\mfc41.dll (detected \nas TROJ_YAHAMAM)\n• % windows %\\inf\\mfc41.inf (a configuration \nfile)\n• % windows %\\Fonts\\mfc41.tff (a copy of the \nconfiguration file)\n• %windows%\\Web Wallpaper\\images.jpg (contains BKDR_YAHAMAM)\nA batch (.BAT) file is used to start the INCS service. \nTROJ_YAHAMAM uses a trick similar to that of \nTROJ_YAHOYAH in order to decrypt files. When decrypted, TROJ_YAHAMAM executes the backdoor \npayload.A more in-depth analysis \nof the downloaded file reveals that malicious \ncode has been \nappended to it. This allows TROJ_YAHOYAH to check offset 0x0F \nbytes from the end of \nthe file code to identify a marker where the malicious binary code \nwill be added, thus \nincreasing the file’s size.\nTROJ_YAHOYAH \nlooks for the string, “EHAGBPSL,” and \ndecrypts the appended \nbinary code. When decrypted, an .EXE file is executed in memory. It \nautomatically runs if the \nuser has administrator privileges. If the user has \nlimited privileges though, \nit will first attempt to obtain administrator privileges by bypassing User Account Control (UAC) but only on Windows 7. It will \nthen decrypt another XOR-encrypted file using the \nkey “0x90” in memory then check if the “StartWork” function was exported then execute it.\nOther images used in \nattacksMalicious code appended to that of the .JPG file\n7 | Page © 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\nBackdoor Payload: BKDR_\nYAHAMAM\nBKDR_YAHAMAM is usually encrypted then \nembedded in an image file. When decrypted, it is \nloaded and executed in memory by a .DLL file that \nis registered as a service (TROJ_YAHAMAM). It exfiltrates data from infected systems, downloads and uploads files, and has a remote shell. It also drops \na rootkit component named “usb.sys,” detected as \nRTKT_HIDEPORT.ZTCA-XO. The rootkit creates \nthe service, usb30, and hides evidence of port communication to evade detection and remain \npersistent.\nCommand-and-Control \nCommunication\nWhen executed, BKDR_YAHAMAM checks if it runs \nunder svchost.exe. It uses the configuration file, \n%windows %\\Fonts\\mfc41.tff, which contains the \nfollowing information:\n• C&C1\n• C&C2\n• C&C3\n• ControlPort\n• DownloadURL1\n• DownloadURL2• DownloadURL3\n• LoginPass (for authentication purposes)\n• Port1\n• Port2\n• Port3\n• USB\n• UserMark\nBKDR_YAHAMAM encrypts C&C communication using multiplication with a 1-byte key. Attackers can \nuse the “?” and “Help” commands to see the various \noptions the backdoor offers as shown in its code.\nWe were able to download some files from two of the \nC&C servers that TROJ_YAHAMAM accesses. These \nhad some image files that the 32- and 64-bit versions of the backdoor can choose from for use in attacks.\nTool used to emulate command-and-control (C&C) \ncommunication with a 64-bit version of BKDR_YAHAMAMOperation Tropic Trooper Research Paper8 | Page © 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\nOperation Tropic Trooper Research Paper9 | Page © 2015 Trend Micro IncorporatedThe following table lists the unique SHA-1 hashes that TROJ_YAHAMAM downloads, along with their backdoor \npayloads.\nFilename SHA-1 HashBackdoor \nPayloadTrend Micro \nDetection \nName\n3.jpgc5359ecc1651a98125bf7ea2668f85af64a7a  \n533HL3.7x86_20140711 BKDR_YAHAMAM\n32.jpg872cbe46a84fb88836db2a15e92d8c80d420  \n9af3HL3.7x86_20150122 BKDR_YAHAMAM\nbd2015.24.jpg8ee9bdab29970c95f9ed5915813543609b7f  \n438cHL3.7x86_20150122 BKDR_YAHAMAM\nlclc_0725.jpgfedb2c7b5f6a11ddefd29eb034e85f17c612e  \n3baHL3.7x86_20140508 BKDR_YAHAMAM\nSmartNavport0205.32.gif75940e926894b65652bb84d96fe42fe709a1  \n83f5HL3.7x86_20150122 BKDR_YAHAMAM\nualband.24.jpg6d82e1aafd910b93ebf2ece773d43e9ccbbf8  \n4f3HL3.7x64_20140711 BKDR_YAHAMAM\nInterestingly, a BKDR_POISON variant was found on the sites’ folders as well, leading us to believe that the attackers also use it for Operation Tropic Trooper.C&C servers TROJ_YAHAMAM accesses to download malicious payloads\nOperation Tropic Trooper Research Paper10 | Page © 2015 Trend Micro IncorporatedFilename SHA-1 HashTrend Micro Detection \nName\nwshif.dll a7b4381b1f9161992b358eda9bd58a6b219a13d3 BKDR_POISON.TUFN\nwship.dll 4eedf918aeb1a2bedc6278e89ebf3005d0b95d41 BKDR_POISON.TUFN\nBKDR_YAHAMAM can steal practically any type of file saved on infected systems. Apart from stealing data, \nit can also perform more harmful actions like kill processes and services, delete files and directories, and put \nsystems to sleep, among others.\nBKDR_YAHAMAM also attempts to install an accompanying executable rootkit (%windows %\\system32\\\ndrivers\\usb30.sys, detected as RTKT_HIDEPORT.ZTCA-XO). RTKT_HIDEPORT.ZTCA-XO is also XOR \nencrypted and found at byte key, “0x90,” to hide the port that the backdoor should use according to the configuration file. It will only hide communication activities occurring in the first of three port entries indicated in the configuration file. After creating and starting the rootkit service, BKDR_YAHAMAM then attempts to delete \nthe rootkit and the related service. This will not stop the rootkit from running in the background.\nBKDR_YAHAMAM variants with rootkits for 32-bit systems run on 32-bit versions of Windows XP. On Windows \n7 64-bit systems, however, the backdoor works but the rootkit does not.\nLateral Movement\nIn the course of doing research, we also managed to get hold of the following tools that the actors behind Operation Tropic Trooper used in an attack:\n• HKTL_GETOS: Detects a target system’s OS version. \n[10]\n• HKTL_SHARESCAN: Performs the following:\n -pr: Scans for open ports on target systems.\n -letmein: Scans for saved usernames and passwords on target systems.\n -arp: Views the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) on each target system.\n -netview: Scans target systems for shared resources.\nHKTL_GETOS’s OS-version-sniffing \nroutine11 | Page © 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\nThese hacking tools were possibly remotely downloaded by the attackers onto infected systems. They aided in \nlateral movement and further intelligence gathering. Data such as credentials saved on infected systems can \nbe stolen via Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning or main-in-the-middle (MiTM) Layer 2 and pass-\nthe-hash attacks. [11–12]  The stolen credentials allow attackers laterally move throughout a network. The threat \nactors no longer have to hack their way in, they have the ability to log in as legitimate users.\nHKTL_SHARESCAN’s routines (top left: -pr; top right: -letmein; bottom left: -arp; bottom right: -netviewOperation Tropic Trooper Research Paper12 | Page © 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated\nPossible \nConnections\nBased on the specially crafted documents we were able to gather, \nOperation Tropic Trooper has been active since 2012.

Although we were not able to collect enough information to determine the identities and \nmotivations of the actors behind Operation Tropic \nTrooper, we were able to gather enough intelligence to help potential victims defend against the campaign. Knowing that attackers are still using old techniques \nand exploiting known vulnerabilities will make it easier for the targeted organizations to pinpoint and fix \nsecurity gaps in their networks.\nBuilding threat intelligence is crucial in the fight \nagainst targeted attacks. Identifying the tools, \ntactics, and procedures (TTPs) that threat actors \nuse based on external reports and internal historical and current monitoring can help create a strong database of indicators of compromise (IoCs) that can \nserve as basis for action.
