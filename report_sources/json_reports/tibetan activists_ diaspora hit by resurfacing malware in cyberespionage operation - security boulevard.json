One of the e-mail addresses used to send spear phishing messages in the Resurfaced Campaign\n(tibetanparliarnent[@]yahoo.com) was also used repeatedly during the Parliamentary Campaign.”\nMalicious campaigns have so far targeted Tibetan activists, journalists, members of the Tibetan Parliament in exile and the\nCentral Tibetan Administration, as part of a large-scale cyberespionage operation. Researchers believe the same hacker group\ncould be behind all the campaigns on the Tibetan diaspora, which has been highly targeted in the past ten years.\nThe Tibetan activist who received the infected files was suspicious from the get-go as this wasn’t the first time such an attempt\nwas made. Even though the email seemed legitimate, it contained a Power Point presentation and a text file.\nOnce analyzed by Citizen Lab, they concluded the two were indeed infected with malicious code meant to infect Windows\ncomputers. In comparison with the previous campaign which relied on targeted malware, known exploits and basic Remote\nAccess Trojans, the 2018 campaign relied more on social engineering schemes to trick the victims into opening the corrupted\nfiles and steal credentials through phishing attempts.\n“The campaign used social engineering to trick targets into opening exploit-laden PowerPoint ( CVE-2017-0199 ) and Microsoft\nRich Text Format (RTF) documents ( CVE-2017-11882 ) attached to e-mail messages,” writes Citizen Lab. “The malware includes a\nPowerShell payload we call DMShell++, a backdoor known as TSSL , and a post-compromise tool we call DSNGInstaller.”\n*** This is a Security Bloggers Network syndicated blog from HOTforSecurity  authored by Luana Pascu .
