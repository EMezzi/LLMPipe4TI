While it has not been named, Zscaler told SecurityWeek  that the\ntargeted organization is a multi‐national financial services firm with locations across Europe,\nMiddle East and Asia.\n“The main motive of this group is to monitor and exfiltrate intellectual property data from\nthe target organization,” Zscaler researchers explained in a blog post .\nThe attack targeting the financial services firm started with a spear phishing message\ncontaining a malicious URL. The link pointed to a server in Hong Kong set up to host the\nHacking Team Flash Player exploit . The attackers attempted to use the exploit to install a\nvariant of the HttpBrowser remote access Trojan (RAT) hosted on the same Hong Kong‐based\nserver, which has also been used for command and control (C&C).\nHttpBrowser RAT, a piece of malware that is highly popular among APT groups, leverages a\nlegitimate digitally signed executable from Symantec to decrypt and run the RAT payload\nwithout being detected.\nThe financial services firm targeted by the cyber espionage group is a Zscaler customer and\nthe security company said it blocked the attack before any damage was caused.\nZscaler told SecurityWeek  that Emissary Panda has also leveraged another Hacking Team Flash\nPlayer exploit (CVE‐2015‐5123) in its operations. According to the company, the attack on the\nfinancial services firm was not an isolated incident ‐‐ Zscaler plans on releasing additional\nresearch in the upcoming days.\nSeveral exploits were leaked online after the Italian surveillance software company Hacking\nTeam suffered a data breach, and Emissary Panda is not the only APT actor to use the spyware\nmaker’s exploits.\nThe Chinese group known as Wekby  (APT 18) has also used at least one of the exploits to\ndeliver Gh0st RAT. Cyber espionage groups such as Pawn Storm , APT3 and Darkhotel  have\nalso leveraged Hacking Team’s exploits in their campaigns.\nA report published earlier this month by Dell’s SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit revealed that\nEmissary Panda has become more selective  when it comes to data exfiltration.\nThe group has targeted a wide range of companies over the past years, including automobile,\nelectronics, aircraft, pharmaceutical, and oil and gas manufacturers. Up until recently, the\nthreat actor stole all the information it could find on compromised networks, but now it has\nchanged its tactics and only takes what it believes to be more valuable.\n Search\nBusiness Email AddressSUBSCRIBE TO THE DAILY BRIEFING\n   \n   \n    \nMost Recent Most Read\nCisco Patches Several Vulnerabilities in SD‐WAN\nSolution\nResearchers Track Coronavirus‐Themed\nCyberattacks\nAnalyzing Cyberspace Solarium Commission's\nBlueprint for a Cybersecure Nation\nSixgill Introduces Dark Web Data Feed Product\nAdobe Patches Critical Flaws in Reader,\nColdFusion, Other Products\nVMware Fixes Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in\nFusion for Mac\nThe Human Element and Beyond: Why Static\nPasswords Aren't Enough\nRansomware Is Mostly Deployed After Hours:\nReport\nThe Other Virus Threat: Surge in COVID‐Themed\nCyberattacks\nBarr: FBI Probing If Foreign Gov't Behind HHS\nCyber Incident\nPopular Topics\nInformation Security News\nIT Security News\nRisk Management\nCybercrime\nCloud Security\nApplication Security\nSmart Device Security\nSecurity Community\nIT Security Newsletters\nICS Cyber Security Conference\nCISO Forum, Presented by Intel\nInfosecIsland.Com\nStay Intouch\nTwitter\nFacebook\nLinkedIn Group\nCyber Weapon Discussion\nGroup\nRSS Feed\nSubmit Tip\nSecurity Intelligence Group\nAbout SecurityWeek\nTeam\nAdvertising\nEvents\nWriting Opportunities\nFeedback\nContact Us\nCopyright © 2020 Wired Business Media.
