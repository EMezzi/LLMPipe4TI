The actor typically targets\nCentral Asian countries, Russia, Belarus, Mongolia, and others.” reads the analysis  published by Proofpoint.\n“TA549 possesses a diverse malware arsenal including PlugX, NetTraveler, and ZeroT”\nThe TA459 APT group has been active since at least 2013, the hackers leveraged several malware in\ntheir campaign, including NetTraveler  , PlugX, Saker, Netbot, DarkStRat, and ZeroT. The hackers most\nfocused their efforts on spying on organizations in Russia and neighboring countries.\nThe attacks conducted by the TA459 APT group were apparently aimed at analysts covering the\ntelecommunications industry, Proofpoint researchers speculate this latest campaign is likely a\ncontinuation of the campaign they uncovered in the summer of 2015.\n“Proofpoint researchers recently observed a campaign targeting telecom and military in Russia. Beginning in July\n2015 (and possibly earlier), the attack continued into August” wrote  Proofpoint.\nThe TA459 APT leveraged spear-phishing emails using weaponized Word document that trigger the\nCVE-2017-0199 flaw. The hackers started exploiting the Office flaw just a few days after Microsoft\nreleased a fix .\nWhen victims open the decoy document, an HTML application (HTA) file disguised as an RTF\ndocument is downloaded. The attack exploits PowerShell to download and executes a script that\nfetches and runs the ZeroT downloader .\nProofpoint noticed some improvements in the last ZeroT version such as the use of a legitimate\nMcAfee utility for sideloading instead of a Norman Safeground utility.\n“The attack group has made incremental changes to ZeroT since our last analysis. While they still use RAR SFX\nformat for the initial payloads, ZeroT now uses a the  legitimate McAfee utility named mcut.exe instead of the\nNorman Safeground AS for sideloading as they have in the past. The encrypted ZeroT payload, named Mctl.mui,\nis decoded in memory revealing a similarly tampered PE header and only slightly modified code when compared\nto ZeroT payloads we analyzed previously.” continues the analysis.\nProofpoint reported that the TA459 APT group used both PlugX and a Trojan tracked as PCrat/Gh0st\nin the last wave of attacks.\nThe experts invite multinational organizations to stay vigilant about state-sponsored actors that use\nsophisticated malware in their cyber espionage campaigns.\n“Ongoing activity from attack groups like TA459 who consistently target individuals specializing in particular\nareas of research and expertise further complicate an already difficult security situation for organizations dealing\nwith more traditional malware threats, phishing campaigns, and socially engineered threats every day.”\n concluded Proofpoint.\n[adrotate banner=”9 ″]\nPierluigi Paganini\n(Security Affairs  – TA459 APT group, cyber espionage)\n[adrotate banner=”13 ″] \n APT CVE-2017-0199 cyber espionage Hacking malware TA459 APT\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKEShare this...\nPREVIOUS ARTICLE\nNumber of WordPress Attacks powered\nby compromised routers is rapidly\ndropping\n NEXT ARTICLE\nTravel Tech Giant Sabre suffered a Data\nBreach, traveler data potentially at riskAlways Enabled Necessary \n "
