This campaign infected victims with Sakula  malware variants that were signed with\nstolen certificates. Investigation into this activity led to associations with the adversary known to\nCrowdStrike as DEEP PANDA.\nOn 31 July 2014, an executable was identified, which, at the time, was not detected by any anti-virus products.\nWhen this file was executed, it caused the victim to view a website by using the ShellExecute() API to open a\nURL. The site’s domain name was meant to spoof that of a site set up to provide information on an alumni\nevent for a U.S university. This page requested that the visitor download an Adobe-related plugin in order to\nview the content. The downloaded plugin file included a variant of Sakula malware. [1]\nThe Sakula malware in this campaign utilized the Dynamic Link Library (DLL) side-loading technique most\ncommonly associated with PlugX  activity. In the aforementioned university-related incidents, a legitimate\nexecutable named MediaSoft.exe (MD5 hash: d00b3169f45e74bb22a1cd684341b14a) loaded a file named\nmsi.dll (MD5 hash: ae6f33f6cdc25dc4bda24b2bccff79fe), which, in turn, was used to load the Sakula\nexecutable (MD5 hash: 0c2674c3a97c53082187d930efb645c2). This final executable was also signed with a\ncertificate assigned to an organization called DTOPTOOLZ Co., Ltd.\nCommand-and-Control (C2) communications in this incident went directly to IP address 180.210.206.246; a\nsample GET request is below:\nFurther investigation revealed similar activity stretching back to at least April 2014, when similar TTPs were\nused to target a healthcare organization and a U.S.-based IT company with high-profile clients in the\ndefense sector. Two other incidents were also identified in August 2014 targeting a company in the DIB and a\nMongolian government entity.\nAll incidents in this campaign were similar in that they utilized malicious droppers masquerading as\ninstallers for legitimate software applications like Adobe Reader, Juniper VPN, and Microsoft ActiveX\nControl. They display progress bars that make it appear as if the specified software is being updated or\ninstalled.\nExample of Installer Progress Bar Displayed by Dropper\nIn addition, the droppers all directed victims to login pages for services specific to the target organization\nlike webmail, document sharing, or corporate VPN. In all cases except one, the victims were directed to\nlegitimate login pages. The one exception was a case in which victims were sent to a login page hosted on a\ndomain that spoofed that of the legitimate one. It is unclear whether redirecting victims to these login pages\nwas part of credential-collection activity or merely meant to deceive victims into believing that the activity\nwas legitimate.\nExample of a Login Page that Victims were Redirected to\nThe campaign appeared to be over by the end of August, but a file was recently discovered that suggests it\nmay be ongoing. The intended target again appeared to be a Mongolian government entity, and the file\nmasqueraded as an installer for Microsoft ActiveX software. It dropped the side-loaded Sakula malware just\nlike in the other incidents; however, in this instance, the Sakula payload was signed with a certificate\nassigned to a different organization, Career Credit Co., Ltd. The malware used the domain www[.]xha-\nmster[.]com  for C2 which was created in mid-September and is registered with the email address\nwendellom@yahoo.com and registrant name “tonyy starke ” (hence the name, Ironman-related title for this\nblog).\nBelow is a chart showing the relevant relationships to this DEEP PANDA campaign.\nThe bottom of the chart shows an infrastructure connection between an IP address (198.200.45.112) used this\ncampaign and also used in recently observed DEEP PANDA activity.\nAssociation with Recent Scanbox Activity\nIn September 2014, CrowdStrike Intelligence identified a malicious file signed with the DTOPTOOLZ Co., Ltd.\ncertificate. Analysis of this file revealed it to be Derusbi malware (a favorite RAT of DEEP PANDA) that used\nthe domain vpn[.]foundationssl[.]com  for its C2. At the time of discovery, CrowdStrike did not attribute the\nfile to DEEP PANDA based on the malware alone, but the use of the DTOPTOOLZ certificate to sign a malware\nvariant known to be heavily used by this adversary makes it likely that this signed Derusbi sample is also\nattributable to DEEP PANDA.\nIn a recent public report from PWC , another foundationssl[.]com  domain was linked to activity involving the\nStrategic Web Compromise (SWC) framework more commonly known as Scanbox. In that operation, the\nScanbox code was placed on the website of a U.S.-based think tank and utilized the malicious domain,\nnews[.]foundationssl[.]com . The use of the two foundationssl[.]com  subdomains suggests that the same\nadversary (in this case DEEP PANDA) was responsible for the signed Derusbi malware file and the think tank\nSWC activity. Furthermore, CrowdStrike publicly reported  on DEEP PANDA targeting of think tanks in July\n2014.\nIf you want to hear more about DEEP PANDA and their tradecraft or any of the other adversaries that\nCrowdStrike tracks, please contact: sales@crowdstrike.com\n \n[1] In February 2014, CrowdStrike publicly reported on a campaign that leveraged Sakula malware\n(https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/french-connection-french-aerospace-focused-cve-2014-0322-attack-\nshares-similarities-2012/index.html ); however, the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) between that\ncampaign and this recent one are different, suggesting two distinct adversaries are using the Sakula\nmalware.\nRelated Content\n(179)ENDPOINT PROTECTION\n(13)ENGINEERING & TECH\n(105)EXECUTIVE VIEWPOINT\n(87)FROM THE FRONT LINES\n(124)RESEARCH & THREAT INTEL\n(67)TECH CENTER\n\nSee CrowdStrike\nFalcon in Action\nDetect, prevent, and respond to\nattacks— even malware-free\nintrusions—at any stage, with\nnext-generation endpoint\nprotection.\nSEE DEMO\nTRY CROWDSTRIKE FREE FOR 15 DAYS GET STARTED WITH A FREE TRIAL\n      \nCopyright © 2020 CrowdStrike | Privacy | Request Info | Blog | Join Our Team | Sitemap | Contact Us | 1.888.512.8906 English\n\n  BLOG FEATURED RECENT VIDEOS CATEGORIES\n Featured \nRecent \nVideos\nCategories \n "
