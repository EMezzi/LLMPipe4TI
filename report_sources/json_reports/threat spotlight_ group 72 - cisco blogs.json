This may be a way of walking, an accent, a turn of phrase or a style of\ndressing. If you know what to look for you can easily spot a friend or acquaintance in a crowd by knowing what characteristics to look for.\nExactly the same is true for threat actors.\nEach threat actor group may have certain characteristics that they display during their attack campaigns. These may be the types of\nmalware that they use, a pattern in the naming conventions of their command and control servers, their choice of victims etc. Collecting\nattack data allows an observer to spot the characteristics that define each group and identify specific threat actors from the crowd of\nmalicious activity on the internet.\nTalos security and intelligence research group collects attack data from our various telemetry systems to analyse, identify and monitor threat\nactors through their different tactics, techniques, and procedures. Rather than give names to the different identified groups, we assign\nnumbers to the threat actors. We frequently blog about significant attack campaigns that we discover, behind the scenes we integrate our\nintelligence data directly into our products. As part of our research we keep track of certain threat actor groups and their activities. In\nconjunction with a number of other security companies, we are taking action to highlight and disrupt the activities of the threat actors\nidentified by us as Group 72.\nGroup 72 is a long standing threat actor group involved in Operation SMN , named Axiom by Novetta. The group is sophisticated, well\nfunded, and possesses an established, defined software development methodology. The group targets high profile organizations with high\nvalue intellectual property in the manufacturing, industrial, aerospace, defense, media sectors. Geographically, the group almost exclusively\ntargets organizations based in United States, Japan, Taiwan, and Korea. The preferred tactics of the group include watering-hole attacks,\nspear-phishing, and other web-based tactics.\nThe tools and infrastructure used by the attackers are common to a number of other threat actor groups which may indicate some degree of\noverlap. We have seen similar patterns used in domain registration for malicious domains, and the same tactics used in other threat actor\ngroups leading us to believe that this group may be part of a larger organization that comprises many separate teams, or that different\ngroups share tactics, code and personnel from time to time.\nIt is possible that Group 72 has a vulnerability research team searching for 0-day vulnerabilities in Windows. The group is associated with\nthe initial attack campaigns utilising exploits for the following vulnerabilities  CVE-2014-0322   and  CVE-2012-4792  . We have also\nobserved them using SQL injection as part of their attacks, and exploits based on  CVE-2012-1889   and CVE-2013-3893 .\nFrequently the group deploys a remote access trojan (RAT) on compromised machines. These are used both to steal data and credentials\nfrom compromised machines, and to use the machine as a staging post to conduct attacks against further systems on the network, allowing\nthe attackers to spread their compromise within the organization. Unlike some threat actors, Group 72 does not prefer to use a single RAT\nas part of their attacks. We have observed the group to use the following RAT malware:\nGh0st RAT (aka Moudoor)\nPoison Ivy (aka Darkmoon)\nHydraQ (aka 9002 RAT aka McRAT aka Naid)\nHikit (aka Matrix RAT aka Gaolmay)\nZxshell (aka Sensode)\nDeputyDog (aka Fexel) — Using the kumanichi and moon campaign codes\nDerusbi\nPlugX (aka Destroy RAT aka Thoper aka Sogu)\nHydraQ and Hikit, according to our data are unique to Group 72 and to two other threat actor groups.\nWhile their operational security is very good, patterns in their domains can be identified such as seemingly naming domains after their\nintended victim. We have observed domains such as  companyname.attackerdomain.com  and companyacronym.attackerdomain.com . We\nhave also observed similar patterns in the disposable email addresses used to register their domains. These slips, among others, allow us to\nfollow their activities. Intriguingly we have observed the same email address being used in the activities of this and two other threat actor\ngroups. This may suggest that these three groups are indeed one unit, or possibly hint at shared staff or ancillary facilities.\nWe will post a follow up with more technical detail in the coming days.\nClamAV names and Snort Signature IDs detecting Group 72 RAT malware:\nGh0stRat — Win.Trojan.Gh0stRAT, 19484, 27964\nPoisonIVY / DarkMoon — Win.Trojan.DarkMoon, 7816, 7815, 7814, 7813, 12715, 12724\nHydraq — Win.Trojan.HyDraq, 16368, 21304\nHiKit — Win.Trojan.HiKit, 30948\nZxshell — Win.Trojan.Zxshell, 32180, 32181\nDeputyDog — Win.Trojan.DeputyDog, 28493, 29459\nDerusbi — Win.Trojan.Derusbi, 20080\nProtecting Users Against These Threats\n \nAdvanced Malware Protection ( AMP) is ideally suited to detect the sophisticated malware used by this\nthreat actor.\n CWS  or WSA  web scanning prevents access to malicious websites, including watering hole attacks, and\ndetects malware used in these attacks.\n The Network Security protection of  IPS and NGFW  have up-to-date signatures to detect malicious\nnetwork activity by threat actors.\n ESA can block spear phishing emails sent by threat actors as part of their campaign.\nTags: APT  malware  Operation SMN  security  SMN  Talos  threats\n2 Comments\nBlake VandeVelde  says:\nNovember 3, 2014 at 12:43 pm\nI see mention made of “The Network Security protection of IPS and NGFW have up-to-date signatures to detect malicious network activity\nby threat actors.” There are four CVE’s listed in this article, and I only see two of them (the ones from 2012) showing up in the ASA CX IPS\nproduct. None of the other threat names show up in the ASA CX IPS either. We have the latest Oct 2014 signatures.\nBased on this document, ( http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/asa-5500-series-next-generation-firewalls/eos-eol-notice-\nlisting.html ) ASA CX is not EOL, so there ought to be regular IPS signatures coming out to protect us against things like this. When will we\nbe protected against these threats?\nAlex Chiu  says:\nNovember 3, 2014 at 3:01 pm\nBlake,\nCisco CX IPS is not designed to address the entire range of signatures offered by the Cisco IPS. It is targeted for specific deployments and\nruns a subset of the signatures from the Cisco IPS. Each new IPS signature is evaluated, and when possible, implemented on CX.\nIf you have any further questions on CX signature coverage feel free to reach out to ips-signature-team@cisco.com .\nComments are closed.\nCONNECT WITH CISCO\n    \nLET US HELP\nCall us: 1.800.553.6387  - Ext 118\nUS/Can | 5am-5pm Pacific Other Countries\nShare\nCisco Consent Manager\nLike many companies, Cisco uses cookies and other technologies, some of which are\nessential to make our website work.
