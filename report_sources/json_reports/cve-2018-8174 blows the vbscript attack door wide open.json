Since then, it has appeared in\nadditional attack campaigns. The vulnerability, CVE-2018-8174 , dubbed \"Double\nKill\",  is significant  on several counts.\nINCREASE IN UAF EXPLOITS\nFor one, it is a great example of a use-after-free (UAF) memory vulnerability\ncategory, a class of vulnerabilities we are seeing with increasing frequency. The\nheavily exploited Flash vulnerability CVE-2018-4878 , reported in early February,\nalso triggered a UAF vulnerability. And the Acrobat Reader double-free vulnerability,\nCVE-2018-4990 currently exploited in the wild, falls in this category as well. UAF\nvulnerabilities are particularly dangerous as they can enable the execution of\narbitrary code, or, in some cases full remote code execution due to easier access\nto read and write primitives (read and write to the full process virtual memory).\nNEW ATTACK VECTOR\nIt also opens the door to an entirely new attack vector by expanding the\ndestructive impact of Visual Basic vulnerabilities. Until now, Visual Basic\nvulnerabilities could only be utilized inside the Internet Explorer browser as only IE\nsupports Visual Basic. This limited their scope and effectiveness. The latest attack\nthat utilized CVE-2018-8174 also used URL Moniker technique to load the\nVisualBasic exploit directly into the Office process. This significantly changes the\ncurrent attack vector landscape by introducing previously known Internet explorer\nbrowser exploits directly into Office documents This means it can be ported both\nto spear-phishing campaigns and drive-by campaigns to reach a much wider\naudience of targets.\nWe expect to see malspam campaigns exploiting CVE-2018-8174 in the\nvery near future.\nTARGETED ATTACK TO MASS MARKET IN DAYS\nThis vulnerability has set new records in terms of migration from targeted 0-day\nattack to criminal mass market exploit kit. Attacks in the wild were first discovered\nat the end of April. Microsoft released a patch on May 8. It was integrated into the\nMetasploit framework less than two weeks later and within two days was\nincorporated into the RIG exploit kit . With the addition of this new vulnerability,\nRIG is likely to see a resurgence in popularity.\nHOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM DOUBLE KILL\nIf you can, patch. Microsoft included a patch for CVE-2018-8174 in it's May 2018\nupdates.\nIf you are a Morphisec customer, you are protected even if you cannot\npatch immediately.  Morphisec stops Double Kill across its attack chain. It\nprevents the exploit execution both from a weaponized Word file and any exploit\nkit that may deliver the exploit directly into the Internet Explorer browser.\nRESOURCES\nhttps://malware.dontneedco ee.com/2018/05/CVE-2018-8174.html\nhttps://github.com/smgorelik/Windows-RCE-exploits/tree/master/Web/VBScript\nhttps://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-\nguidance/releasenotedetail/a82328f9-1f26-e811-a968-000d3a33a34d\nhttp://blogs.360.cn/blog/cve-2018-8174-en/SUBSCRIBE TO OUR BLOG\nStay in the loop with industry insight,\ncyber security trends, and cyber attack\ninformation and company updates.\nMICHELE\nARMELLINI\nMICHELE.ARMELLINI@STUDENTI.UNITN.IT\nCOMPANY\nSUBSCRIBE\nSEARCH OUR SITE\nRECENT POSTS\nParallax: The New RAT on the Block\nRemote Employees O er Di erent\nSecurity Challenges\nWhy Client-Grade Technology\nDoesn't Cut It for Cloud Workload\nProtection\nTrickbot Delivery Method Gets a\nNew Upgrade Focusing on Windows\n10\nIntroducing the Morphisec Uni ed\nThreat Prevention Platform --\nVersion 4\nEndpoint Security Is Harder than\nEver\nTrickbot Trojan Leveraging a New\nWindows 10 UAC Bypass\nMorphisec Protects Customers\nAgainst Internet Explorer Scripting\nEndpoint Detection and Response Is\nNot the Next Step\nAre Guests Safe From a Hotel Data\nBreach?\nPOSTS BY TAG\nCyber Security (94)\nEndpoint Security (74)\nAttack Analysis (45)\nCyber Attacks (45)\nCompany News (38)\nSee all\nContact SalesABOUT US\nNews\nEvents\nCareers\nPARTNERS\nRESOURCESBLOG\nCONTACT\nUS\nSUPPORT\n© 2020 Morphisec Ltd. | All rights reserved | Privacy Policy    Share Like 0Share\nKeyword...\nPRODUCTS SOLUTIONS BY INDUSTRY SOLUTIONS BY USE CASE\nAdvanced Endpoint\nPrevention\nVirtual Desktop Protection\nCloud Workload Protection\nServer ProtectionSMB\nManufacturing\nFinance\nTechnology\nHealthcare\nLegalAntivirus Replacement\nRansomware Prevention\nVirtual Patching &\nCompliance\nPoint-Of-Sale Protection\nSupply Chain Attack\nProtection\nBrowser Attack ProtectionBLOGCONTACT US SUPPORT\nREQUEST A DEMO PARTNERS RESOURCES PRODUCTS SOLUTIONS COMPANY\nThis website stores cookies on your computer.
