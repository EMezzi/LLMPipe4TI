Following the\nApril 2017 Patch Tuesday, in which Microsoft disabled EPS, FireEye detected a second unknown vulnerability in\nEPS.” reads the analysis  shared by FireEye.\n“FireEye believes that two actors – Turla  and an unknown financially motivated actor – were using the first EPS\nzero-day ( CVE-2017-0261 ), and APT28  was using the second EPS zero-day ( CVE-2017-0262 ) along with a new\nEscalation of Privilege (EOP) zero-day ( CVE-2017-0263 ). Turla  and APT28  are Russian cyber espionage groups\nthat have used these zero-days against European diplomatic and military entities.
