In a\nnew analysis of the threat group, known for its widespread attacks against banks in Eastern\nEurope over the past several years, the Cobalt Group has recently been observed updating\nits arsenal with a new version of the ThreadKit malware.\nIn a report issued by security firm Fidelis on Tuesday  (PDF), researchers outline a number of\nnew developments including:\nDespite an arrest earlier this year of a key member, of the Cobalt Group remains active.\nA new version on the malware ThreadKit is being actively distributed in October 2018.\nThe CobInt trojan uses a XOR-based obfuscation technique.\nReemergence of Cobalt Group\nThe Cobalt Group first appeared in 2013 and in 2016 made a name for itself with widespread\nattacks on banks and ATM jackpotting campaigns across Europe. In one single campaign, it\nwas credited for stealing over $32,000 from six Eastern Europe ATMs. In the following years\nthe Cobalt Group expanded its focus to include financial-sector phishing schemes and new\nregions, including North and South America.\nIn March, the Cobalt Group was dealt a severe blow when the EUROPOL announced  the\narrest of the “criminal mastermind” behind the group in Alicante, Spain. Since then, the\ngroup was observed by Positive Technology  in May as the criminals behind a spear phishing\ncampaign directed at the financial sector that had the goal of enticing victims to download a\nJavaScript backdoor.\n“In 2017 they expanded their targets from banks to include supply chain companies, financial\nexchanges, investment funds,  and lenders in North America, Western Europe, and South\nAmerica. Tools used in 2017 included PetrWrap , more_eggs, CobInt and ThreadKit,” wrote\nJason Reaves, principal, threat research with the Fidelis Threat Research Team in the report.\nThreadKit 2.0\nAfter the arrest of Cobalt Group’s leader, in May the group was spotted changing up its\ntactics. To that end, the Cobalt Group began focusing on exploits used for remote code\nexecution found in Microsoft Word ( CVE-2017-8570, CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2018-\n0802 ) and one notably being the now patched April 2017 zero-day bug  (CVE-2017-0199 ).\n“In October 2018, [we] identified a new version of ThreadKit. As per Cobalt Group’s typical\nmethods, the malware was delivered via phishing email, containing a RFT Microsoft Office\nattachment which contained an evolved version of the exploit builder kit first uncovered in\nOctober 2017,” according to Fidelis. “[This] new version of ThreadKit [utilizes] a macro\ndelivery framework sold and used by numerous actors and groups.”\nFidelis’ latest analysis of the ThreadKit also notes “a slight evolution” in the exploit kit\ndesigned to better hide from detection. Obfuscation techniques include “placing the ‘M’\nfrom the ‘MZ’ of an executable file into it’s own object and now renaming a number of the\nobjects inside.”\nFidelis also pointed out the update including a new download URL where the malware code\n“objects” are downloaded from and later combined to create the executable. “A few\nhighlights from the embedded files shows a check for block.txt, which is similar to the\nprevious version’s kill-switch implementation,” Reaves wrote.\nCobInt Adopts New Obfuscation Skills  \nThe ThreadKit payload is the trojan Coblnt, a longtime favorite of the Cobalt Group. To\nfurther frustrate analysis and detection, the attackers added another layer of obfuscation, a\nXOR routine used to decode the initial Coblnt payload. A XOR, or XOR cipher, is an\nencryption algorithm that operates on a set of known principles. Encryption and decryption\ncan be performed by applying and reapplying the XOR function.\n“What’s interesting here is that the XOR key is replaced by the subtraction value and the\nsubtraction value is replaced by the previously read DWORD value. So the only value that’s\nneeded is the hardcoded XOR key, meaning mathematically this entire thing can be solved\nusing a theorem prover such as Z3,” researchers pointed out.\nThe decoded payload is the CobInt DLL, which when loaded will “sit in a loop beaconing to\nits C2 and waiting for commands and modules to be executed,” according to Fidelis.\nFidelis and other researchers say the arrest of Cobalt group members have only temporarily\nslowed Carbanak/Cobalt threat actors. In a recent analysis by Kaspersky Lab, researchers\nsaid Cobalt arrests have only emboldened members and hastened the process of splitting\nthe groups into smaller cells .\n \nShare this article:\nCryptography\n Hacks\n Malware\n Vulnerabilities\nInnovative PureLocker\nRansomware Emerges in\nTargeted Attacks\nPureLocker is an example of the\nsustained and continuing efforts\nransomware threat actors are putting\ninto malware development.\nNovember 14, 2019\nFIN6 Switches Up PoS Tactics\nto Target E-Commerce\nThe group is using the More_eggs\nJScript backdoor to anchor its attack.\nAugust 29, 2019\nOil and Gas Firms Targeted By\nNew LYCEUM Threat Group\nA new threat group has been\ndiscovered targeting Middle Eastern\ncritical infrastructure firms with\nspearphishing emails laced with\nmalware.\nAugust 27, 2019\nA Practical Guide to Zero-Trust\nSecurity\nJanuary 15, 2020  2\n7 Tips for Maximizing Your SOC\nDecember 31, 2019  5\nMean Time to Hardening: The Next-\nGen Security Metric\nDecember 30, 2019  4\nCombining AI and Playbooks to\nPredict Cyberattacks\nDecember 26, 2019  1\nThe Case for Cyber-Risk Prospectuses\nDecember 24, 2019  1\nNewsletter\nSubscribe to Threatpost Today  \nJoin thousands of people who receive the\nlatest breaking cybersecurity news every day.\nSubscribe now\nTwitter\n cybercriminals targeted the\nNutriBullet website for weeks, stealing\nthe payment card data of its online c… \n54 mins ago\nFollow @threatpost\n#Magecart\nhttps://t.co/cmaHwShKSZ\nThe First Stop For Security News Home\n About Us\n Contact Us\n Advertise With Us\n RSS Feeds\nCopyright © 2020 Threatpost Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Advertise\n Black Hat Breaking News Cloud Security Critical Infrastructure Cryptography Facebook\nGovernment Hacks IoT Malware Mobile Security Podcasts Privacy RSAC\nSecurity Analyst Summit Videos Vulnerabilities Web Security\nSUGGESTED ARTICLES\nDISCUSSIONINFOSEC INSIDER\nTOPICS\nSubscribe to our newsletter, Threatpost Today !
