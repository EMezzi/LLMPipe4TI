The banks\nwere infected through spear phishing emails and the group took\nadvantage of poorly patched, network-misconfigured systems.\nOnce a system was infected, the malware provided the conduit for\nFIN7 to covertly spy on staff, watch how they transferred cash, and\nthen mimic the techniques to transfer funds fraudulently without\ndetection.\nFIN7 has been connected to attacks using legitimate software  which\nare aimed at business credentials, and recently, the hacking group\nhas been linked to campaigns  against US restaurant chains.\nCybersecurity researchers from Seattle-based Icebrg  have now\nuncovered a change in attitude from FIN7, which has ramped up its\ninfiltration techniques to avoid detection.\nHuawei’s Wi-Fi 6 innovations are powering new enterprise\nnetworks\nCustomers prefer Huawei Wi-Fi 6 solutions for a number of key reasons\nSponsored by Huawei\nIn a blog post earlier this week , researchers Alex Sirr and Spencer Walden said that FIN7 has\nrecently focused on improving their phishing documents, with the latest update receiving a\nconcerning initial detections on VirusTotal of 0/59 and 1/59 for RTF and DOCX formats\nrespectively -- which means that traditional antivirus software may not be enough to pick up\nmalicious code embedded in a seemingly legitimate business email.\n\"While the newly observed malicious documents do not represent a \"new\" attack methodology,\nthe change of payload may cause detection issues for legacy signatures and heuristic detections\nwhich utilize overly strict detection mechanisms, lacking in durability or layered coverage,\" the\nresearchers said.\nThe threat actors use phishing to gain an initial foothold into a corporate network. Once complete,\nthe group then paves their way through to Point of Sale (PoS) systems in order to steal credit card\ndata, which can then be used in identity theft or potentially card cloning, should the information\nnot be encrypted well.\nFIN7 now uses a modified payload with an embedded file type for the first wave of attack. In the\npast, the cyberattackers have been spotted using malicious shortcut files (LNK) or visual basic\nscripts (VBS or VBE) to lay the trap for remote code execution.\nThese files were embedded into malicious documents using the Windows Object Linking and\nEmbedding (OLE) framework.\nHowever, it appears the hackers are now switching from LNK files to OLE embedded CMD files.\nThese files are underlain with JScript, and writes a \"tt.txt\" files to the victim's home directory. The\nscript then uses the JScript engine on the file, also leading to code execution, but is more difficult\nto spot.\nIn addition, FIN7's custom backdoor, HALFBAKED, has evolved. In the newest version, changes\nhave been made to obfuscation techniques.\nOriginally, HALFBAKED utilized base64 encoding, stored in a string array variable called \"srcTxt.\"\nNow, this name is obfuscated and the string is broken up into multiple strings.\nThe backdoor is also equipped with a command called \"getNK2\" which is designed to covertly pull\na victim's full Microsoft Outlook email client auto-complete list, which suggests the threat group is\nkeen to acquire as many new targets as possible.\n\"Detection authors must make trade-offs to optimize signature performance; narrow signatures\nlead to high fidelity detections, but risk missing changes in actor behaviors, meanwhile broader\ndetection patterns provide better coverage, at the risk of more false positives,\" the researchers\nnote. \"Combatting a well-resourced and adaptive adversary requires a layered approach of both\nsignature styles.\"\nMust-have mobile apps to encrypt your texts...\nPREVIOUS AND RELATED COVERAGE\nCybercrime gang uses Google services for malware command and control\nGang behind multiple cyberattacks on banks and financial institutions has found a new way\nto manage its activities.\nCarbanak hacking group steal $1 billion from banks worldwide\nCarbanak malware offered criminals the chance to steal up to $10 million per heist.\nNew Trojan malware attack targets restaurant chains\nDubbed Bateleur, this malware uses with macro-laden phishing emails that allow attackers\nto take screenshots, steal passwords, and more.\nRELATED TOPICS:  SECURITY TV  DATA MANAGEMENT  CXO  DATA CENTERS\nBy Charlie Osborne  for Zero Day  | October 10, 2017 -- 08:50\nGMT (09:50 BST)  | Topic: Security\n SHOW COMMENTS\n1 - 5 of 9 NEXT \nRecommended For You by Taboola Sponsored Links\nSmart Watch\nNew Classy $109\nSmartwatch Takes Italy By\nStorm\nSaverDaily\nVerona: Le auto che nel\n2019 sono rimaste\ninvendute non dovrebbero … Vikings: Gioco online gratuito\nSe hai più di 50 anni, questo\ngioco è un must!\nComparaSemplice\nPrezzi Luce a partire da\n0,037€ kwh.
