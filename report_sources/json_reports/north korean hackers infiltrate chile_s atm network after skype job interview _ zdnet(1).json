Collected information included the PC's username, hardware and OS\ndetails, proxy settings, a list of current processes, if the infected host had RPC and SMB open file\nshares, and the status of its RDP connection.\nThe collected information would have been able to tell the hackers what computer they infected,\nand later decide if they'd want to deliver a second stage payload in the form of a more intrusive\nPowerShell script.\nThe Redbanc incident is yet another example of how one worker clicking on the wrong link or\nrunning the wrong file can result in a major security breach, and how one hacked PC or laptop can\nlead to an entire network getting compromised .\nPreviously, according to an indictment by US authorities , Lazarus Group hackers have been\naccused of attempting to steal money from Banco de Chile , a local Chilean bank.\nCybercrime and malware, 2019 predictions\nMORE CYBERSECURITY NEWS:\nAnonymous hacker gets 10 years in prison for DDoS attacks on children's hospitals\nG Suite update warns you when someone is exporting your company's data\nUS charges Ukrainian for SEC 2016 hack, others for insider trading\nA security conference will let you hack a Tesla car and earn cash prizes\nLiberian ISP sues rival for hiring hacker to attack its network\nHacker 'BestBuy' sentenced to prison for operating Mirai DDoS botnet\nGoogle now lets you donate to charity through the Play Store  CNET\nPhishing and spearphishing: A cheat sheet for business professionals  TechRepublic\nRELATED TOPICS:  SECURITY TV  DATA MANAGEMENT  CXO  DATA CENTERS\nBy Catalin Cimpanu  for Zero Day  | January 16, 2019 -- 02:08 GMT\n(02:08 GMT)  | Topic: Security\n SHOW COMMENTS\n1 -
