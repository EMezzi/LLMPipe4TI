The update addresses\na zero-day vulnerability  (CVE-2017-11292) that researchers\nfound actively exploited by a group of threat actors\nknown as BlackOasis. \nAccording to researchers, BlackOasis exploits CVE-2017-\n11292 to distribute the information-stealing malware FinSpy, a lso known as FinFisher (detected\nby Trend Micro as BKDR_FINSPY.A, TROJ_FRS.0NA003JC17, and\nWORM.Win32.TRX.XXPE002FF019). Last September, the group used a separate remote code\nexecution (RCE) vulnerability ( CVE-2017-8759 ) to deliver a variant of the spyware, which is\nreportedly  being sold by its developers and operators as a suite of surveillance software.\nResearchers note that the attacks they’ve observed in the wild are targeting Windows\nmachines. \nBlackOasis’s attack involves the use of spear-phishing  emails sent to targets of interest. These\nmalicious emails are attached with a Flash exploit within an ActiveX object embedded in a Word\ndocument. The infection chain is multi-stage, using several scripts to retrieve, decrypt, and\nexecute the payload. \nCVE-2017-11292  is a memory corruption flaw that can let an attacker execute arbitrary code on\na vulnerable system when successfully exploited. Attackers can lure victims with specially\ncrafted Flash content. While it’s currently reported to be used in targeted attacks, its public\ndisclosure is likely to make others employ it for their own cybercriminal activities. In fact, some\nof the other vulnerabilities that BlackOasis use in their campaigns have been employed by\nother cyberespionage and cybercriminal groups:\nBlackOasis uses sociopolitical themes as social engineering lures. Like other cyberespionage\ngroups such as BlackTech, ChessMaster , and Pawn Storm , BlackOasis employs decoy\ndocuments to divert the would-be victim’s attention away from their ulterior motive: steal\nconfidential, mission-critical information. The researchers that monitored BlackOasis note that\nit is currently targeting Middle Eastern  politicians and United Nations officers, as well as\njournalists and activists. BlackOassis’s activities and FinSpy were also observed in Russia, the\nU.K., Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, and African countries. \nIndeed, vulnerabilities are the bread and butter for many targeted attacks, and patching plays a\ncrucial role  in defending against them. In the first half of 2017, 382 new vulnerabilities  were\nreported and disclosed via Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative, 92 of which were from Adobe—a\nnumber that's markedly higher than that of the second half of 2016. Enterprises need to\nbalance their need for maintaining the infrastructure that drives their organizational operations,\nand the significance of securing them. Defense in depth provides layers of protection against\nthreats that take advantage of security gaps. Some of the best practices to defend against these\ntypes of threats include:\nTrend Micro Solutions\nTrend Micro ™ Deep Discovery ™ provides detection, in-depth analysis, and proactive\nresponse to today’s stealthy malware, and targeted attacks in real-time. It provides a\ncomprehensive defense tailored to protect organizations against targeted attacks and\nadvanced threats through specialized engines, custom sandboxing , and seamless correlation\nacross the entire attack lifecycle, allowing it to detect threats like the above mentioned zero-\nday attacks even without any engine or pattern update. Trend Micro™ Deep Security ™\nand Vulnerability Protection  provide virtual patching  that protects endpoints from threats\nthat abuses unpatched vulnerabilities.  \nGiven how BlackOasis uses email as an entry point, organizations need to further secure the\nemail gateway to mitigate threats delivered by BlackOasis.
