    "text": "Share post on:Dropping Elephant (also known as “Chinastrats” and “ Patchwork “) is a relatively new threat actor that is targeting a variety of\nhigh profile diplomatic and economic targets using a custom set of attack tools. Its victims are all involved with China’s\nforeign relations in some way, and are generally caught through spear-phishing or watering hole attacks.\nOverall, the activities of this actor show that low investment and ready-made offensive toolsets can be very effective when\ncombined with high quality social engineering. We have seen more such open source toolset dependency with meterpreter\nand BeEF, and expect to see this trend continue.\nThe Attack Method: Infection Vector\nDropping Elephant uses two main infection vectors that share a common, and fairly elaborately maintained, social\nengineering theme – foreign relations with China.\nThe first approach involves spear-phishing targets using a document with remote content. As soon as the user opens the\ndocument, a “ping” request is sent to the attackers’ server. At this point, the attackers know the user has opened the\ndocument and send another spear-phishing email, this time containing an MS Word document with an embedded\nexecutable. The Word document usually exploits CVE-2012-0158. Sometimes the attackers send an MS PowerPoint\ndocument instead, which exploits CVE-2014-6352.\nOnce the payload is executed, an UPX packed AutoIT executable is dropped. Upon execution, this downloads additional\ncomponents from the attackers’ servers. Then the stealing of documents and data begins.\nThe second approach involves capturing victims through watering hole attacks. The actor created a website that downloads\ngenuine news articles from other websites. If a website visitor wants to view the whole article they would need to download\na PowerPoint document. This reveals the rest of the article, but also asks the visitor to download a malicious artifact.\nThe two main infection vectors are supported by other approaches. Sometimes, the attackers email out links to their\nwatering hole websites. They also maintain Google+, Facebook and twitter accounts to develop relevant SEO and to reach\nout to wider targets. Occasionally, these links get retweeted, indiscriminately bringing more potential victims to their\nwatering holes.\nThe Attack Tools\n1. Malware Analysis\nThe backdoor is usually UPX packed but still quite large in size. The reason for this is that most of the file comprises\nmeaningless overlay data, since the file is an automatically generated AutoIT executable with an AutoIT3 script embedded\ninside. Once started, it downloads additional malware from the C2 and also uploads some basic system information,\nstealing, among other things, the user’s Google Chrome credentials. The backdoor also pings the C2 server at regular\nintervals. A good security analyst can spot this while analyzing firewall log files and thereby find out that something\nsuspicious might be going on in the network.\nGenerally speaking, backdoors download additional malware in the form of encrypted or packed executables/libraries. But,\nin the case of Dropping Elephant, the backdoor downloads encoded blobs that are then decoded to powershell command\nline “scripts”. These scripts are run and, in turn download the additional malware.\nOne of the more interesting malware samples downloaded is the file-stealer module. When this file-stealer is executed, it\nmakes another callback to the C2 server, downloading and executing yet another malware sample. It repeatedly attempts to\niterate through directories and to collect files with the following extensions: doc, docx, ppt, pptx, pps, ppsx, xls, xlsx, and\npdf. These files are then uploaded to the C2 server.\nAlso interesting are the resilient communications used by this group. Much like the known actors Miniduke or\nCommentCrew, it hides base64 encoded and encrypted control server locations in comments on legitimate web sites.\nHowever, unlike the previous actors, the encrypted data provides information about the next hop, or the true C2 for the\nbackdoor, instead of initial commands.\n2. C2 Analysis\nIn many cases it was very difficult to get a good overview of the campaign and to find out how successful it is. By combining\nKSN data with partner-provided C2 server data, we were able to obtain a much fuller picture of the incident.\nWe examined connections and attack logins to this particular C2. As it turned out, the attackers often logged in via a VPN,\nbut sometimes via IPs belonging to an ordinary ISP in India. We then looked at the time the attackers were active, of which\nyou can find an image below.\nVictim Proﬁle and Geography\nWe also wanted to get a better idea of the geolocation of most visitors. Analysis of the image provided access counts and\ntimes, along with the IP of the visiting system.\nNoteworthy are the many IPs located in China. This focus on China-related foreign relations was apparent from the ongoing\nsocial engineering themes that were constant throughout the attacks. The concentration of visits from CN (People’s\nRepublic of China) could be for a variety of reasons – diplomatic staff are visiting these sites from their CN offices, CN\nacademics and analysts are very interested in researching what they believe to be CN-focused think tanks, or some of the\nIPs are unknown and not self-identifying as bots or scrapers. Regardless, because we were able to determine that multiple\ntargets are diplomatic and governmental entities, these foreign relations efforts are likely to represent the main interest of\nthe attackers.\nConclusion\nCampaigns do not always need to be technically advanced to be successful. In this case, a small group reusing exploit code,\nsome powershell-based malware and mostly social engineering has been able to steal sensitive documents and data from\nvictims since at least November 2015.\nOur analysis of the C2 server confirmed the high profile of most victims, mainly based in the Asian region and specially\nfocused on Chinese interests. Actually, some hints suggest the group has been successful enough to have recently\nexpanded its operations, perhaps after proving its effectiveness and the value of the data stolen.\nThis is quite worrying, especially given the fact that no 0 days or advanced techniques were used against such high profile\ntargets. Simply applying software patches will prevent attacks based on old exploits, as well as training in the most basic\nsocial engineering attacks.\nHowever, it should be noted that in this case Microsoft´s patch for exploit CVE-2014-1761 just warns the user not to allow\nthe execution of the suspicious file.\nDropping Elephant artifacts are detected by Kaspersky Lab products as:\nExploit.Win32.CVE-2012-0158.*\nExploit.MSWord.CVE-2014-1761.*\nTrojan-Downloader.Win32.Genome.*\nHEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic\nAs usual Kaspersky Lab actively collaborates with CERTs and LEAs to notify victims and help to mitigate the threat.
