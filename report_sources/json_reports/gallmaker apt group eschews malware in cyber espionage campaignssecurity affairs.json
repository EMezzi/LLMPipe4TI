According to\nresearchers from Symantec, who first spotted the threat actor, the group has launched attacks on\nseveral overseas embassies of an unnamed Eastern European country, and military and defense\norganizations in the Middle East.\nGallmaker is a politically motivated APT group that focused its surgical operations on the\ngovernment, military or defense sectors.\nGallmaker been active since at least December 2017, researchers observed a spike in its operations in\nApril and most recent attacks were uncovered in June.\nThe experts speculate the threat a nation-state actor, it is interesting to note that the APT is relying\nentirely on code scraped from the public internet.\n“This group eschews custom malware and uses living off the land (LotL) tactics and publicly available hack tools\nto carry out activities that bear all the hallmarks of a cyber espionage campaign,” reads the analysis published by\nSymantec .\n“The most interesting aspect of Gallmaker’s approach is that the group doesn’t use malware in its operations.\nRather, the attack activity we observed is carried out exclusively using LotL tactics and publicly available hack\ntools.”\nGallmaker uses spear phishing messages using a weaponized Office document that uses the Dynamic\nUpdate Exchange (DDE) protocol to execute commands in the memory of the targeted device.\n“These lure documents use titles with government , military, and diplomatic themes, and the file names are\nwritten in English or Cyrillic languages. These documents are not very sophisticated, but evidence of infections\nshows that they’re effective.” continues  Symantec.\n“By running solely in memory, the attackers avoid leaving artifacts on disk, which makes their activities difficult\nto detect.”\nOnce the attackers gain access to a target machine, they use various tools including the reverse_tcp\nreverse shell from Metasploit, the WindowsRoamingToolsTask PowerShell scheduler, the WinZip\nconsole, and an open source library named Rex PowerShell, which helps create PowerShell scripts for\nMetasploit exploits.\nExperts discovered that Gallmaker APT is using three primary IP addresses for its C&C infrastructure,\nthey also noticed the attackers use to delete some of its tools from compromised machines once it is\ncompleted the attack, likely to hide traces of their activity.\n“The fact that Gallmaker appears to rely exclusively on LotL tactics and publicly available hack tools makes its\nactivities extremely hard to detect. We have written extensively about the increasing use of LotL tools  and\npublicly available hack tools by cyber criminals. ” concluded Symantec. “One of the primary reasons for the\nincreased popularity of these kinds of tools is to avoid detection; attackers are hoping to “hide in plain sight”, with\ntheir malicious activity hidden in a sea of legitimate processes.” \nPierluigi Paganini\n(Securi ty Affairs  – Gallmaker, cyber espionage)\n APT cyber espionage Gallmaker Hacking Pierluigi Paganini Security Affairs\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKEShare this...\nPREVIOUS ARTICLE\nSAP October 2018 set of patches fixes\nfirst Hot News security note for SAP\nBusinessObjects in 5 years\n NEXT ARTICLE\nJuniper Networks provides dozens of fix\nfor vulnerabilities in Junos OSHome  Cyber Crime  Cyber warfare  APT  Data Breach  Deep Web  Digital ID  Hacking  Hacktivism  Intelligence  Internet of Things  Laws and regulations  Malware  Mobile  Reports  Security  Social Networks  \nTerrorism  ICS-SCADA  EXTENDED COOKIE POLICY  Contact meHome  Cyber Crime  Cyber warfare  APT  Data Breach  Deep Web  Digital ID  Hacking  Hacktivism  Intelligence  Internet of Things  Laws and regulations  Malware  Mobile  Reports  Security  Social Networks  Terrorism  ICS-SCADA  EXTENDED COOKIE POLICY  Contact me\nAlways Enabled Necessary \n "
