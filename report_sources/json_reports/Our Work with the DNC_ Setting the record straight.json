We began our work\nwith the DNC on May 1, 2016, collecting intelligence\nand analyzing the breach. After conducting this\nanalysis and identifying the adversaries on the\nnetwork, on June 10, 2016 we initiated a coordinated\nremediation event to ensure the intruders were\nremoved and could not regain access. That\nremediation process lasted approximately 2-3 days\nand was completed on June 13, 2016.\nWhy did the DNC contact CrowdStrike?\nThe DNC contacted CrowdStrike to respond to a\nsuspected cyber attack impacting its network. The\nDNC was first alerted to the hack by the FBI in\nSeptember 2015. According to testimony by DNC IT\ncontractor Yared Tamene Wolde-Yohannes, the FBI\nattributed the breach to the Russian Government in\nSeptember 2015 (page 7).\nWhy did the DNC hire CrowdStrike instead of just\nworking with the FBI to investigate the hack?\nThe FBI doesn’t perform incident response or network\nremediation services when organizations need to get\nback to business after a breach.\nCrowdStrike is a leader in protecting customers\naround the world from cyber threats.

CrowdStrike’s conclusion that Russia was behind\nthe DNC hack is supported by the U.S. Intelligence\ncommunity and also by independent Congressional\nreports. Most recently, the Senate Intelligence\nCommittee released a report in April 2020 that\nvalidated the previous conclusions of the Intelligence\nCommunity Assessment, published on January 6,\n2017, all concluding that Russia was behind the DNC\ndata breach.\nPage 157 of the Senate report states that the\nSelect Committee on Intelligence “conducted\nan extensive examination of the intelligence\ndemonstrating Russia’s intrusions into DNC\nnetworks.“ Senator Richard Burr (R – North\nCarolina), who served as Chairman of the\nSenate Intelligence Committee at the time the\nreport was issued, confirmed this finding:\n“The Committee found no reason to dispute\nthe Intelligence Community’s conclusions.”\nThe Intelligence Community Assessment,\npublished on January 6, 2017 also confirms\n\n\n\n\n✉ | BLOG\nFeatured\nRecent\nVideos\nCategories\nStart Free T rial10/10/22, 6:09 PM Our W ork with the DNC: Setting the r ecord straight\nhttps://www .crowdstrik e.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/ 6/40that Russia was behind the DNC hack, stating\non page 2 of the report: “In July 2015,\nRussian intelligence gained access to\nDemocratic National Committee (DNC)\nnetworks and maintained that access until at\nleast June 2016. This unclassified ODNI\nreport was based on extensive classified\nintelligence collected by the CIA, NSA, and\nFBI; the ODNI determined the classified\nintelligence should not be released in order to\nprotect the sensitive sources and methods by\nwhich it was collected.\nIt’s also worth noting that other security companies,\nincluding Fidelis and FireEye have supported\nCrowdStrike’s analysis.\nDoes CrowdStrike have evidence that data was\nexfiltrated from the DNC network?\nYes. Shawn Henry stated in his testimony to the\nHouse Intelligence Committee that CrowdStrike had\nindicators of exfiltration (page 32)  and that data had\nclearly left the network. Also, on page 2, the\nIntelligence Community Assessment also confirmed\nthat the Russian intelligence agency GRU “had\nexfiltrated large volumes of data from the DNC.”\nDid CrowdStrike see in real-time the adversaries\nexfiltrate data and emails from the DNC network? \n\n\n\n\n✉ | BLOG\nFeatured\nRecent\nVideos\nCategories\nStart Free T rial10/10/22, 6:09 PM Our W ork with the DNC: Setting the r ecord straight\nhttps://www .crowdstrik e.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/ 7/40No and that’s typical for incident response cases. In\nthe vast majority of cyber investigations, incident\nresponders don’t witness exfiltration in real-time. In\nfact, often we are called in after theft has taken place.\nWe collect forensics, evidence of prior activity on the\nnetwork, map where the adversary has gained access\nand prepare remediation plans.\nIn this particular case, CrowdStrike saw circumstantial\nevidence of data exfiltration from the DNC network.\nAs a reference point circumstantial evidence is the\ntype of evidence such as DNA analysis or fingerprints\nthat are fully admissible in courts.\nShawn Henry stated in his testimony that CrowdStrike\nhad indicators of exfiltration (page 32 of the\ntestimony):\n“Counsel just reminded me that, as it relates to the\nDNC’ we have indicators that data was exfiltrated. We\ndid not have concrete evidence that data was\nexfiltrated from the DNC, but we have indicators that\nit was exfiltrated.’\nand circumstantial evidence that data was taken as he\nstates on page 75 ”so there is circumstantial evidence\nthat it was taken” and page 76:\n“MR. HENRY: So, to go back, because I think it’s\nimportant to characterize this. We didn’t have a\nnetwork sensor in place that saw data leave’ We said\nthat the data Ieft based on the circumstantial\nevidence.

Mueller also cites the theft\nof documents from the DNC and DCCC on page 40,\nstating the following:\n“Officers from Unit 26165 stole thousands of\ndocuments from the DCCC and DNC networks,\nincluding significant amounts of data pertaining to the\n2016 U.S. federal elections. Stolen documents\nincluded internal strategy documents, fundraising\ndata, opposition research, and emails from the work\ninboxes of DNC employees.”\nIs it true that part of the exfiltration happened\nafter CrowdStrike was already engaged by the\nDNC? \nThis question about the specific timeline of the\nexfiltration is addressed directly by Shawn Henry in\nhis testimony on page 26.\n“MR. HENRY: So the analysis started the first day or\ntwo in May, and then that was about 4 to 6 weeks.

So that would have been June 10th\nwhen we started. And we did the remediation event\nover a couple of days.”\nOf note, it is a standard practice in incident response\nto first coordinate a remediation event to prevent the\nadversary from doing further damage and following\nthat to fully restore network functionality. We followed\nindustry best practices to accomplish the fastest\nremediation path for our customer.\nOn page 27 of Shawn Henry’s testimony, he further\nexplains CrowdStrike’s role as incident responders:\n“To be clear, our goal, my goal was to protect the\nclient. We were hired to protect the client. We\nidentified an adversary there. The goal was to make\nsure that the adversary was removed and the client\nhad a clean environment with which to work.”\nDid any DNC endpoints protected by your\ntechnology get breached in subsequent attacks? \nThere is no indication of subsequent breaches taking\nplace on any DNC machine protected by CrowdStrike\nFalcon.\nDo you have a comment about the allegation that\nRussia stole Democratic Party emails from John\nPodesta and then passed them to WikiLeaks? \n\n\n\n\n✉ | BLOG\nFeatured\nRecent\nVideos\nCategories\nStart Free T rial10/10/22, 6:09 PM Our W ork with the DNC: Setting the r ecord straight\nhttps://www .crowdstrik e.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/ 10/40CrowdStrike was not involved in investigating John\nPodesta’s email leaks.

We deployed our IR team and technology and\nimmediately identified two sophisticated adversaries\non the network – COZY BEAR and FANCY BEAR.\nWe’ve had lots of experience with both of these actors\nattempting to target our customers in the past and\nknow them well. In fact, our team considers them\nsome of the best threat actors out of all the numerous\nnation-state, criminal and hacktivist/terrorist groups\nwe encounter on a daily basis. Their tradecraft is\nsuperb, operational security second to none and the\nextensive usage of ‘living-off-the-land’ techniques\nenables them to easily bypass many security solutions\nthey encounter. In particular, we identified advanced\nmethods consistent with nation-state level capabilities\nincluding deliberate targeting and ‘access\nmanagement’ tradecraft – both groups were\nconstantly going back into the environment to change\nout their implants, modify persistent methods, move to\nnew Command & Control channels and perform other\ntasks to try to stay ahead of being detected. Both\nadversaries engage in extensive political and\neconomic espionage for the benefit of the government\nof the Russian Federation and are believed to be\nclosely linked to the Russian government’s powerful\nand highly capable intelligence services.\n\n\n\n\n✉ | BLOG\nFeatured\nRecent\nVideos\nCategories\nStart Free T rial10/10/22, 6:09 PM Our W ork with the DNC: Setting the r ecord straight\nhttps://www .crowdstrik e.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/ 27/40COZY BEAR (also referred to in some industry reports\nas CozyDuke or APT 29) is the adversary group that\nlast year successfully infiltrated the unclassified\nnetworks of the White House, State Department, and\nUS Joint Chiefs of Staff.

While\nyou would virtually never see Western intelligence\nagencies going after the same target without de-\nconfliction for fear of compromising each other’s\noperations, in Russia this is not an uncommon\nscenario. “Putin’s Hydra: Inside Russia’s Intelligence\nServices”, a recent paper from European Council on\nForeign Relations, does an excellent job outlining the\nhighly adversarial relationship between Russia’s main\nintelligence services – Федеральная Служба\nБезопасности (FSB), the primary domestic\nintelligence agency but one with also significant\nexternal collection and ‘active measures’  remit,\nСлужба Внешней Разведки (SVR), the primary\nforeign intelligence agency, and the aforementioned\nGRU.
