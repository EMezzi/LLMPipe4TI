The Meterpreter attacks,\nKaspersky Lab said, could be connected to the GCMAN and Carbanak groups , which were\nresponsible for $1 billion in thefts from financial institutions , according to a 2015 report .\nFireEye calls this group FIN7 and said it was targeting individuals involved in SEC filings.\nThe framework has since disappeared online following a brief interaction with the attacker\nand Morphisec researchers. Omri Dotan of Morphisec said the researchers attempted to\nbuild some trust with the attacker and tried to communicate in Russian before he disabled\nthe command and control infrastructure and removed the framework.\n“There is a high level of probability that we have attributed a whole bunch of attacks across\nthe globe to one actor and this platform,” Dotan said. “Through this [interaction] we had with\nthem, they took it down and quite likely disrupted any ongoing attacks. Now they are going\nto have to rebuild it and do this stuff over from scratch.”\nMorphisec said in an analysis published today that on March 8 during an investigation into an\nattack against several high-profile enterprises, it found the framework used to deliver a\nnumber of variations of attacks, all of which leave no artifacts on the compromised\nmachines. These artifacts either match, or are similar to, others used in the attacks\ndescribed by Kaspersky and Cisco, they said.\nThe attacks begin with phishing emails targeting organizations using a Word document that\nis protected, which urges the user to enable the content. By doing so, the victim executes a\nmacro embedded in the document that executes a PowerShell command using Windows\nManagement Instrumentation, infrastructure used to automate tasks on remote machines.\nA PowerShell script called Updater.ps1 is enabled that opens a backdoor and grabs\ncommands from the command and control server. It also lowers security restrictions\naround macros so that more macro-based documents can be sent and will execute without\nuser interaction. Morphisec said it found additional scripts on the command and control\nserver that execute Mimikatz, which is used to extract passwords and hashes from memory,\nLaZagne, a open source application used to retrieve credentials stored on a local hard drive,\nand DNS Messenger.\nDotan said Morphisec was on the command and control server for three days and was able\nfingerprint a number of artifacts on the framework, encryption routines and IP addresses\nthat led them to conclude the likely connection with other similar attacks.\n“At some point toward the end of our investigation the attacker contacted our people\nthrough the shellcode. We had a brief interaction where our folks tried to lure the hacker to\nreveal part of his identity,” Dotan said. “At some point, we tried to talk to them in Russian, but\nat that point, he asked for ‘English, please.’ He then started to shut down the command and\ncontrol server and completely took down the platform.”\nDotan said that Morphisec has made all of the artifacts it recovered public but has shared\nthem with Israel’s cybersecurity administration.\nShare this article:\nMalware\nAPT36 Taps Coronavirus as\n‘Golden Opportunity’ to\nSpread Crimson RAT\nThe Pakistani-linked APT has been\nspotted infecting victims with data\nexfiltration malware.\nMarch 17, 2020\nActivities of a Nigerian\nCybercriminal Uncovered\nRise and fall of a Nigerian cybercriminal\ncalled ‘Dton,’ who made hundreds of\nthousands of dollars in a 7-year\ncampaign, outlined in new report.\nMarch 17, 2020\nCoronavirus-Themed APT\nAttack Spreads Malware\nThe APT group was spotted sending\nspear-phishing emails that purport to\ndetail information about coronavirus –\nbut they actually infect victims with a\ncustom RAT.\nMarch 13, 2020\nA Practical Guide to Zero-Trust\nSecurity\nJanuary 15, 2020  2\n7 Tips for Maximizing Your SOC\nDecember 31, 2019  5\nMean Time to Hardening: The Next-\nGen Security Metric\nDecember 30, 2019  4\nCombining AI and Playbooks to\nPredict Cyberattacks\nDecember 26, 2019  1\nThe Case for Cyber-Risk Prospectuses\nDecember 24, 2019  1\nNewsletter\nSubscribe to Threatpost Today  \nJoin thousands of people who receive the\nlatest breaking cybersecurity news every day.\nSubscribe now\nTwitter\nA new Mirai botnet variant is exploiting\na critical  flaw in Zyxel\nnetwork-attached storage devices,\naccor… \n2 hours ago\nFollow @threatpost\n#security\nhttps://t.co/dVEJvNNzmw\nThe First Stop For Security News Home\n About Us\n Contact Us\n Advertise With Us\n RSS FeedsCopyright © 2020 Threatpost Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Advertise\nBlack Hat Breaking News Cloud Security Critical Infrastructure Cryptography Facebook\nSUGGESTED ARTICLES\nDISCUSSIONINFOSEC INSIDER\nSubscribe to our newsletter, Threatpost Today !
