    "text": "PREVIOUS NEXT02/01/2013  BY WOW\nCapstone Turbine Corporation Also\nTargeted in the CFR Watering Hole Attack\nAnd More\nSince the release of MSA-2794220  by Microsoft, regarding the CVE-\n2012-4792  vulnerability, a Fix-it solution has been provided\nKB2794220 . I urgently advise you to apply this Fix-it solution, or to\nuse another browser, until the release of the final patch surely planned\nfor the 8 January Microsoft Patch Tuesday.\nI have some interesting and funny additional information’s regarding\nthe CFR watering hole attack , and I would like to share them with you.\nBut previously I recommend you to read the following analysis done by\nsecurity companies or independent security researchers:\n“CFR WATERING HOLE ATTACK DETAILS ” from FireEye has been\ncompleted with additional information’s.\n“Internet Explorer Zero-Day Used in Watering Hole Attack: Q&A ” from\nSymantec is also a pleasure to read.\n“CVE-2012-4792 – Analysis of today.swf ” from StopMalvertising\nprovide also interesting information’s.\nLet’s start with the analysis of only two samples, “ news_14242aa.html ”\nand “ Helps.html “. These two samples are quiet interesting, and a\ncomplete blog post is enough for them. I will analyze the other samples\nin dedicated further blog posts.\nnews_14242aa.html (545cb268267609910e1312399406cdbc)\nThis sample was extracted from Google cache  with a cache date of 7\nDec 2012 14:12:28 GMT. This sample clearly demonstrate that the\ncompromise of CFR.org wasn’t the 20, or 21 December as mentioned\nby security companies or medias, but really sooner. The proof is still\nindexed and in cache of Google.\nHelps.html (a25c13d4edb207e6ce153469c1104223)\nI received this sample, around the 29 December.  This file is the\nequivalent of the first sample but with some modifications, you can see\nthe differences in the following online diff . Additional languages have\nbeen added (jp – ru – ko),  all the stuffs regarding Microsoft Office\ndocuments have been removed (boy or girl), some additional “blank”\nlocations have been added and the body text has been hide.\nNow, if you do research on VirusTotal with this MD5 , you can find a\nrelate sample, but with another filename “ config.html ” who was\nsubmitted the 2012-12-31 18:29:47 UTC. Looks like interesting, but has\nto be confirmed.\nIf you execute a request on urlQuery in order to search all “ config.html ”\nfile for the last past month , you will discover a submission, dating from\n2012-12-29 22:58:29, for URL\n“http://www.capstoneturbine.com/_include/config.html ” on server\n74.62.198.72 . If you take a look at the urlQuery report you can see\nsome “ deployJavaPlugin ” strings.\nThe Capstone Turbine Corporation  company description, make me\nbelieve that this company profile could be a choice of quality for\ntargeted attack:\nCapstone Turbine Corporation ® is the world’s leading\nproducer of low-emission microturbine systems, and was first\nto market with commercially viable microturbine energy\nproducts. Capstone Turbine has shipped thousands of\nCapstone MicroTurbine systems to customers worldwide.\nBy doing a Google dork research “ site:capstoneturbine.com “_include” ”\nyou can see something strangely similar to CFR.org\n“news_14242aa.html “ file.\nThis page is also cached in google cache, and guess what ? Ho, Ho\nHo, CVE-2012-4792  is in the house since the 18 December 16:10:40\nGMT. So CFR.org was and is not the only target of this attack !\nNow we will try to define the date of compromise of Capstone Turbine\nCorporation through research on Google by another google dork\n““capstoneturbine.com” “_include” “. And we can find some interesting\ninformations \nOn support.clean-mx.de we can discover that the same\n“/_include/config.html ” URL was indexed since 2012-09-19 04:31:01.\nBut what is awesome is the evidence attached to this submission  hoho\nit is CVE-2012-4969  I discovered in September  “Grumgog.swf ” is in\nthe house.\nMy conclusions are:\nCFR.org was comprised since minimum beginning December.\nCVE-2012-4792 was present on CFR.org since minimum beginning\nDecember.\nCVE-2012-4792 was also used to target visitors of another company\nnamed Capstone Turbine Corporation.\nCVE-2012-4792 was present on Capstone Turbine Corporation since\nminimum 18 December.\nCapstone Turbine Corporation was also used to spread CVE-2012-\n4969 and this since mid-September.\nPotentially Capstone Turbine Corporation is compromised since\nminimum beginning September\nPotentially the guys behind CVE-2012-4969 and CVE-2012-4792 are\nthe same.\nBut, there is always a but in a story, take a look at the first submission\nfor Capstone Turbine Corporation in August,\n“http://www.capstoneturbine.com/_flash/videos_native/exploit.html  “.\nImagine \nUpdate 1 – 2013-01-02 1:30 am:\nJindrich Kubec director of Threat Intelligence at avast! confirm\npresence of CVE-2012-4969  in September on Capstone Turbine\nCorporation.\nShare this:\n39 Replies to “Capstone Turbine Corporation Also\nTargeted in the CFR Watering Hole Attack And More”\nPingback: CFR watering hole attack also target Capstone Turbine Corporation |\nMy great WordPress blog\nPingback: Energy Manufacturer Also Victimized by IE Zero Day in Watering Hole\nAttack | Threatpost\nPingback: ForensicsPress.com | Latest IE attack brought by same gang that\nhacked Google\nPingback: Microsoft rushes fix for Internet Explorer vulnerability | My Blog\nPingback: 1-15 January 2013 Cyber Attacks Timeline « Hackmageddon.com\nPingback: Microsoft ships emergency patch for IE6, IE7, and IE8 to fix vulnerability\nused in targeted attacks | Bitmag\nPingback: Microsoft ships emergency patch for IE6, IE7, and IE8 to fix vulnerability\nused in targeted attacks | Magento-Thailand.com | Magento, ?????????????\nMagento, ???????????????????? ???\nPingback: DD Tech Solutions - Microsoft ships emergency patch for IE6, IE7, and\nIE8 to fix vulnerability used in targeted attacks\nPingback: Microsoft ships emergency patch for IE6, IE7, and IE8 to fix vulnerability\nused in targeted attacks - Daily Small Talk\nPingback: Microsoft ships emergency patch for IE6, IE7, and IE8 to fix vulnerability\nused in targeted attacks | Arne Ruhnau News\nPingback: Latest IE attack brought by same gang that hacked Google |\nPadroni.net\nPingback: Latest IE attack brought by same gang that hacked Google |\nImpressiveNews\nPingback: 0-Day-Schwachstelle im Internet Explorer, Ausgabe Dezember 2012 -\nDipl.-Inform.
