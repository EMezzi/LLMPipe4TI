    "text": "Share post on:Two days ago FireEye reported  that the recent CVE-2013-3906 exploit has begun to be used by new threat actors other\nthan the original ones. The new infected documents share similarities with previously detected exploits but carry a different\npayload. This time these exploits are being used to deliver Taidoor and PlugX backdoors, according to FireEye.\nAt Kaspersky Lab we have also detected that yet another APT group has just started spreading malicious MS Word\ndocuments exploiting CVE-2013-3906. This APT actor is the Winnti group, which we described in detail here . They have\nsent spear-phishing emails with an attached document containing the exploit. As usual the Winnti perpetrators are trying to\nuse this technique to deliver 1st stage malware – PlugX.\nWe became aware of an attack against one gaming company which constantly undergoes attacks from the Winnti group.\nThe MS Word document containing the exploit shows the same TIFF “picture” – 7dd89c99ed7cec0ebc4afa8cd010f1f1  –\nthat triggers the exploitation of the vulnerability, as in the Hangover attacks. If the exploitation is successful, the PlugX\nbackdoor is downloaded from a remote URL:\nhxxp:// 211.78.90.113/music/cover/as/update.exe .\nAccording to the PE header, this PlugX sample was compiled on November 4, 2013 . The internal functional PlugX Dynamic\nLink Library that is decrypted and allocated in memory during malware execution is a little bit older – it dates from October\n30, 2013 . In terms of its development branches, the version of PlugX which is downloaded is slightly different from the\nconventional PlugX but the same type as the one discovered by FireEye when the malware sends CnC HTTP POST packets\nwith noticeable additional headers:\nFireEye sample Winnti’s variant\nFireEye sample\nPOST /<random [0-9A-F]{24}> HTTP/1.1\nAccept: */*\nFZLK1: 0\nFZLK2: 0\nFZLK3: 61456\nFZLK4: 1Winnti’s variant\nPOST /<random [0-9A-F]{24}> HTTP/1.1\nAccept: */*\nHHV1: 0\nHHV2: 0\nHHV3: 61456\nHHV4: 1\nWinnti’s PlugX is connecting to a new, previously unknown C2, av4.microsoftsp3.com . This domain points to the IP-\naddress 163.43.32.4 . Other Winnti-related domains have been pointing here starting with October 3, 2013:\nad.msnupdate.bz ap.msnupdate.bz\nbook.playncs.com data.msftncsl.com ns3.oprea.biz\nOnce again, we are witnessing a rapid spread of the usage of a recently discovered vulnerability by different APT actors. Due\nto the high level of competition, we have already seen how quickly new exploits are added to different Exploit Packs when\ncybercriminals get involved. It’s not yet clear how the new APT actors have come into possession of the CVE-2013-3906 –\nperhaps they obtained the same “builder” as the Hangover attackers, or acquired just a few samples of poisoned MS Word\ndocuments and adapted them for own needs. Anyway, we can conclude that just as regular cybercriminals under\ncompetition pressure, APT actors too will not rest on their laurels but aim to constantly evolve, perfecting their everyday\nprocesses and working more closely together becoming an ever more dangerous threat.\nDiscovered samples\nExploit.MSOffice.CVE-2013-3906.a\nMS Word document: Questionnaire.docx, 63ffbe83dccc954f6a9ee4a2a6a93058\nBackdoor.Win32.Gulpix.tu\nPlugX backdoor: update.exe, 4dd49174d6bc559105383bdf8bf0e234\nBackdoor.Win32.Gulpix.tt\nPlugX internal library: 6982f0125b4f28a0add2038edc5f038a\nTARGETED ATTACKS  VULNERABILITIES AND EXPLOITS\nRelated Posts\nLEAVE A REPLY\nYour email address will not be published.
