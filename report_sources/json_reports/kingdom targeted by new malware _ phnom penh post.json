If we receive any complaint, we will work out how to deal with it,” he said.\nAccording to the World Bank website, the Mekong water management project is designed “to establish the\nfoundation for the e ective management of water resources and  sheries in the project areas of northeast\nCambodia”.\n e project also falls within the framework of the Mekong River Commission’s (MRC) work on water\nmanagement. Inquiries to the MRC and World Bank went unanswered yesterday.\nTe Navuth, general secretary of the project’s implementing partner, the Cambodia National Mekong\nCommittee, said he was previously unaware of the cyber threat. “Now that I know about it, I will have to\nthink  rst about how this issue should be dealt with,” he said.\nCybersecurity expert Niklas Femerstrand in an email yesterday pointed out that while servers in several\ndi erent countries appear to be the origin the attack, it has been linked to the DragonOK campaign.\n“ e DragonOK campaign has previously [in 2014] targeted organizations in Taiwan, Japan, Tibet and\nRussia, and political organizations in Cambodia since at least January, 2017,” he wrote, adding that there are\n“strong indications” the campaign is “an operation funded by China”.\n“ ey’re looking for any intelligence from anybody, and most probably this is linked to a wider Advanced\nPersistent  reat operation .\n  \n.\n \n. of which right now we are only seeing the iceberg tip,” he wrote, referring to a\ncontinuous covert hacking process used to target a speci c entity.\nProfessor Carlyle  ayer, an Asian security expert at the University of New South Wales, noted Chinese\nstate-sponsored hacking is not necessarily always targeted, but did recall that earlier this year “Chinese\ndirected phishing attacks against Cambodian citizens was reported”, and that some “seemed directed at\nopposition political parties”.\n“While some hacking is speci c, other hacking e orts are designed just to gather information to expand  les\nand data bases,” he wrote.\nAccording to Femerstrand, the best protection is to not open unexpected attachments in emails from\nunveri ed senders and to be wary of external links in documents, in addition to keeping antivirus software\nup to date.\nContact authors: \n Alessandro Marazzi Sassoon\n  \nand \nRinith Taing\nBreaking: Cambodia con rms 12 new Covid-19\ncases, bringing total to 24\n e Ministry of Health con rmed today that 12 new\nCovid-19 positive cases have been identi ed.
