The code exploits a vulnerability disclosed last\nweek  that gives attackers complete control over machines running default\nversions of IE 6 and 7. Version 8 isn't vulnerable, thanks to security\nprotections built into the browser.\nIt's the second report in a week that the previously unknown vulnerability is\nbeing actively exploited to install malware on IE users' machines. Last\nweek, antivirus firm Symantec warned that an undisclosed website had\nbeen compromised so that it was laced with code that targeted the flaw.\nThe attackers then sent emails that lured a select group of people in\ntargeted organizations to the booby-trapped page, causing those who used\nIE versions 6 and 7 to be infected with a backdoor trojan.\nThe underlying security bug resides in a part of IE that handles CSS, or\nCascading Style Sheet, tags. As a result, the browser under-allocates\nmemory, allowing data to be overwritten in memory vtable pointers. By\nspraying memory with special data, an attacker can cause IE to execute\ncode.\nA security protection known as DEP, short for data execution prevention,\nprevents the attack from working. DEP is turned on by default in IE 8.\nMicrosoft has advised those who must use IE 6 and 7 to use a security tool\nknown as EMET  to add DEP to those earlier versions.\nNot that Microsoft or Amnesty International should be singled out. Last\nmonth, a zero-day vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox was exploited on the Nobel\nPeace Prize website .\nThe Amnesty International website is serving a variety of other exploits that\nattack previously patched vulnerabilities in Apple's QuickTime media\nplayer, and Adobe's Flash and Shockwave players.
