BILL LADD\nClick here to download the complete analysis as a PDF .\nExecutive Summary\nEarlier research based on the last two years of vulnerability reporting illustrated that China’s National Vulnerability\nDatabase (CNNVD) was generally more aggressive in capturing up-to-date information for software vulnerabilities than its\nU.S. counterpart (NVD). In this research we examine exceptions to this general rule and discover a broader role for the\nMinistry of State Security (MSS) in vulnerability reporting than was previously known.\nRecorded Future analysis has uncovered evidence of a formal vulnerability evaluation process at CNNVD in which High-\nthreat CVEs are likely evaluated for their operational utility by the MSS before publication.\nWe studied 300 CVEs, representing CVE 1) with the most atypical CNNVD reporting delays, and 2) associated with malware\nused by Chinese APT, and discovered multiple examples where we believe the MSS probably delayed the publication of\nHigh-threat vulnerabilities.\nIn one instance, a Chinese APT group was actively exploiting the Microsoft O ce vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) during\nthe publication lag of 57 days after NVD published.\nThe most atypical publication delay experienced by CNNVD (236 days), was for a pre-installed backdoor that sent vast\namounts of user data to servers in China and was possibly associated with Chinese government surveillance.\nAmong groups of vulnerabilities that were released together, High-threat vulnerabilities were consistently published\nsubstantially later (anywhere from 21 to 156 days later) than Low-threat vulnerabilities.\nFurther, our research on vulnerabilities commonly exploited by malware linked to Chinese APT groups revealed an\ninconsistency in CNNVD publication practices. CNNVD breaks its larger pattern  and is beat to publication by NVD on 97\npercent of these vulnerabilities. The probability that NVD would beat CNNVD to publication for this proportion of CVEs is\nincredibly small — less than .00001 percent . We believe CNNVD publication was likely delayed by the MSS because Chinese\nAPT groups were actively exploiting those vulnerabilities.\nLastly, we discovered that on average, it takes CNNVD longer to publish vulnerabilities with High Common Vulnerability\nScoring System (CVSS)  scores than vulnerabilities with Low ones. This is in contrast to NVD, which publishes High CVSS\nvulnerabilities more quickly than lower ones. We assess that this is likely due to in uence by the MSS in delaying the\npublication of High-threat vulnerabilities in order to evaluate its utility in future intelligence operations, or buy time for\ncurrent ones.\nKey Judgments\nCNNVD is essentially a shell for the MSS; it has a website but appears to be separate from the MSS in name only.\nWe have identi ed at least two examples of vulnerabilities with CNNVD publication delays that we believe were likely\nin uenced by the MSS.\nEven though CNNVD beats NVD to publication 43 percent of the time, for vulnerabilities exploited by malware linked to\nChinese APT groups, CNNVD was  rst to publish for only three percent of those.\nIt takes CNNVD longer to publish vulnerabilities with high CVSS scores than low ones, even though there is no increase\nin published context, indicating that there might be di erent reporting and evaluation procedures for high-threat\nvulnerabilities.\nFor a small subset of vulnerabilities (44 CVEs), NVD is faster than CNNVD to publish vulnerabilities that already have\nexploits for them.\nBackground\nAs we previously reported in “ The Dragon Is Winning ,” the U.S. NVD trails China’s National Vulnerability Database (CNNVD)\nin average time between initial vulnerability disclosure and database inclusion. On average, it takes the U.S. NVD 33 days\nafter public disclosure to make a vulnerability available in its database, while it takes CNNVD only 13 days. Further, CNNVD\ncaptures 90 percent of all vulnerabilities within 18 days; it takes the NVD 92 days to cover that same percentage.\nThe explanation for the delay by NVD is relatively simple — NVD waits for voluntary submissions of information, while\nCNNVD pulls data from extensive sources of vulnerability information across the web, rather than relying on voluntary\nindustry submissions. While the U.S. government has focused on a process, China has focused on the key goal — quickly\nreporting available vulnerabilities.\nFor this research, we studied two groups of CVEs. The  rst, was a statistically unique subset (268 CVEs) of the 17,940\nvulnerabilities  rst publicly disclosed, and then incorporated by both NVD and CNNVD between September 13, 2015 and\nSeptember 13, 2017. This subset waswere of CVEs that were reported quickly by NVD, and slowly by CNNVD. We know from\nour previous research that NVD prioritizes signi cant vulnerabilities for faster release; therefore, when we see CVEs\npublished quickly by NVD followed by a long CNNVD lag, it is extremely atypical. We hereafter refer to these CVEs as the\n“outliers.”\nOur second group of CVEs were of vulnerabilities exploited by malware used by Chinese APT groups. We studied 15\ndi erent pieces of malware used by Chinese APT groups, which included 32 separate CVEs. In total, we studied 300\ndi erent CVEs for this research.\nCNNVD: Thinly Veiled Front Organization for the MSS\nAs we identi ed in additional previous research , CNNVD is run by the China Information Technology Evaluation Center\n(CNITSEC), which is an o ce in China’s premier foreign intelligence service, the Ministry of State Security (MSS). Further\nresearch into the administration of CNNVD has revealed that it is essentially a shell, or cover, for the MSS.\nSubmissions to CNNVD are directed to vulpro@itsec.gov.cn , which is CNITSEC’s domain, as are all contact email addresses\n(that we could discover) for CNNVD.\nVulnerability submission page  for CNNVD.\nFurther, the location and contact information for both CNITSEC and CNNVD are identical. Both are located in the same\nbuilding, on the same  oor, and have the same contact phone numbers.\nContact information for CNITSEC and CNNVD; both list the same contact phone numbers and address.\nThe MSS runs CNNVD. The closest U.S. analog to the MSS is the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the MSS running the\nCNNVD is the equivalent of the CIA running the NVD. Conversely, the CIA does not run the U.S. NVD; it is run by a division\nwithin the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) tasked with publicly identifying, reporting, and creating patches for\nsoftware vulnerabilities. While there is not an exact DHS equivalent in China, the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) mission\nand scope is most similar and is widely considered China’s DHS counterpart.\nThe fundamental problem with the MSS running CNNVD, and more broadly, the MSS’s role in China’s information security\narchitecture, is that the MSS is China’s “ leading civilian intelligence agency ,” responsible for both foreign intelligence and\ncounterintelligence operations. This means that the MSS could use the information gained from vulnerability submissions\nto CNNVD to then exploit in its own intelligence operations. The MSS has a voice in which vulnerabilities are reported via\nthe CNNVD, because they run it; they could also easily identify and hide from the public a critical weakness in software or\nhardware, then turn around and use it in its own operations.\nShared location  of CNITSEC and CNNVD.\nIt is this relationship, where the public defensive mission is supervised by an intelligence service with broad powers to\ncollect intelligence, both domestically and overseas, that led us to investigate CNNVD statistical reporting anomalies in\ngreater depth.\nWhat is the in uence of the MSS on CNNVD, the publishing of vulnerabilities, and public information security in China?\nThreat Analysis\nIn examining the outliers, two analytic questions jumped out from the data. What can we learn from the CVEs that 1)\nexperienced large lags in publishing, and 2) are associated with malware commonly used by Chinese state-sponsored\ngroups?\nLarge Lags in Publishing\nFor the outliers, we decided to examine CVEs that NVD reported on quickly (six days or less), and that CNNVD took over\ntwice as long as its average delay of 13 days to publish. This length of delay (we selected 28 days, or four weeks) is a full 10\ndays longer than the 90 percent publishing rate and should control for the typical organizational and bureaucratic issues\nand delays, like employee vacation, national holidays, systems or network problems, etc.\nOut of the 17,940 vulnerabilities  rst publicly disclosed and then incorporated by both NVD and CNNVD between\nSeptember 13, 2015 and September 13, 2017, 268 vulnerabilities (or approximately 1.5 percent) took less than six days for NVD\nto publish and longer than 28 days for CNNVD to publish .\nAverage reporting delays for all vulnerabilities in time frame and the selected set of vulnerabilities used in this analysis.\nOf these 268, nearly 43 percent had a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)  severity rating of High, 45 percent had\na Medium CVSS rating, and 12 percent were Low.\nWhen these vulnerabilities are broken down further by published date, the data follows a similar pattern. The vast majority\nof the delayed vulnerabilities (74 percent) were published 28 to 50 days after initial report; however, 11 percent were\npublished in 51 to 91 days, and 15 percent took over 120 days to publish.\nAdditionally, there were several companies and projects with numerous vulnerabilities among these outliers, with the\nlargest numbers being from Cisco, Oracle, Linux, Adobe, Google, IBM, and Microsoft, in sequential order.\nAs we identi ed in prior research , for the NVD, higher-severity vulnerabilities have shorter release lags, as more e ort is\nput into communicating and remediating them. However, for CNNVD, the opposite is true. On average, CNNVD takes three\ndays longer to report a vulnerability with a High score than a Low-Medium score.\nSeverity scores of vulnerabilities vs. lag until 90 percent vulnerability coverage. NVD (blue) is faster in publishing high-severity vulnerabilities than\nlower-severity vulnerabilities; CNNVD (green) is slower to publish high-severity vulnerabilities than lower-severity vulnerabilities. Overall, CNNVD\nis still faster.\nThe diverging trend lines in responsiveness to more severe vulnerabilities raise interesting questions about reporting\ncriteria and priorities. While CNNVD is still faster than NVD in each CVSS category, NVD is fastest when reporting High\nvulnerabilities, while High is CNNVD’s slowest category. Further, of the selected outliers, 43 percent were High even though\nthese vulnerabilities make up only about one-third of all total published vulnerabilities. The probability of this degree of\ndi erence occurring by chance is quite small — 0.016 percent .\nWhy is this the case? Does CNNVD publish more content on High and Medium vulnerabilities than on Low ones? What\ncould account for this systemic lag in publishing more severe vulnerabilities, or the fact the nearly 43 percent of the\nstatistical outliers had High CVSS scores?\nA Tale of Two Vulnerabilities\nIn addition to our NVD comparisons and statistical modeling, we decided to compare NVD and CNNVD publish dates and\ncontent for two High vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-0199 and CVE-2016-10136/CVE-2016-10138.\n1. CVE-2017-0199  is a Microsoft O ce vulnerability that was  rst identi ed on April 11, 2017. In the succeeding months, this\nvulnerability was successfully exploited by North Korean state-sponsored actors  in the global WannaCry  attack, the\nunknown actors responsible for NotPetya, and the criminal group behind Dridex. This vulnerability was widely exploited\nacross the world, including in China.\nBelow are side-by-side screenshots of the U.S. NVD and CNNVD entries for CVE-2017-0199 (CNNVD assigns its own\nnumbers and calls this one CNNVD-201704-692).\nBoth NVD and CNNVD contain brief descriptions of the vulnerability, version a ected, and links to the security patch.\nInterestingly, CNNVD’s entry contains fewer references, technical details, and does not list the original identi cation date\n(April 11), only the dates which CNNVD published and updated the entry (both June 7, 2017). CNNVD links to the MITRE\nmaintained CVE entry  and the description of the vulnerability on CNNVD appears to be very similar to the MITRE\ndescription.\nIn comparing the content of both NVD and CNNVD entries for this vulnerability, there is no evident explanation as to why\nCNNVD took 57 days after disclosure to publish. There is no additional content or analysis in CNNVD’s entry. Aside from\nhaving a di erent vulnerability number and risk class score (although it was still the highest category so it was virtually the\nsame), CNNVD actually had less useful data on this particular entry.\nTimeline of cyber events during CNNVD publication lag of CVE-2017-0199.\nHowever, for this particular vulnerability, there may have been other in uencing factors which drove the publication lag.\nResearch published on April 27, 2017, revealed that a suspected Chinese APT group, referred to as TA459, had been using\nthis vulnerability to target analysts who covered the telecommunications industry at Russian and Central Asian  nancial\n rms. This group has also utilized a number of other tools commonly associated with Chinese APT groups, such as PlugX,\nNetTraveler , and Gh0st. In this case, TA459 had been using a trojan called ZeroT to exploit CVE-2017-0199.\nGiven that the MSS runs CNNVD, it is likely that the publication lag for CVE-2017-0199 could have been a ected by the MSS\nwhich wanted to buy time for the vulnerability to be exploited in its operations or on behalf of another Chinese state-\nsponsored actor.\n2. CVE-2016-10136  and CVE-2016-10138  are two vulnerabilities in Android software developed by a company named\nShanghai Adups Technology . According to Kryptowire , these two vulnerabilities are essentially pre-installed backdoors\nwhich, “actively transmitted user and device information including the full-body of text messages, contact lists, call history\nwith full telephone numbers, unique device identi ers including the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), and the\nInternational Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI). The  rmware could target speci c users and text messages matching\nremotely de ned keywords. The  rmware also collected and transmitted information about the use of applications\ninstalled on the monitored device, bypassed the Android permission model, executed remote commands with escalated\n(system) privileges, and was able to remotely reprogram the devices.”\nThe New York Times  wrote a pro le of the two vulnerabilities on November 15, 2016, stating that, “the Adups software\ntransmitted the full contents of text messages, contact lists, call logs, location information, and other data to a Chinese\nserver. The code comes pre-installed on phones and the surveillance is not disclosed to users.” The article went on to\nconnect the Shanghai Adups-developed backdoor to Chinese government surveillance.\nThe episode shows how companies throughout the technology supply chain can compromise privacy, with or without the\nknowledge of manufacturers or customers. It also o ers a look at one way that Chinese companies — and by extension,\nthe government — can monitor cellphone behavior. For many years, the Chinese government has used a variety of\nmethods to  lter and track internet use and monitor online conversations. It requires technology companies that operate\nin China to follow strict rules.\nBelow are screenshots of the NVD and CNNVD entries for CVE-2016-10136 (CNNVD number CNNVD-201701-365).\nSimilar to the entries for CVE-2017-0199, each includes a brief description of the vulnerability and links to references. The\nCNNVD entry, however, contains signi cantly less detail about the vulnerability itself and includes only a generic and\nmisrepresentative statement about the risk to users. “A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read, write, and\ndelete  les, and to gain additional privileges.”\nAdditionally, CNNVD published this sparse writeup over eight months (236 days) after NVD, and nearly 10 months after the\nvulnerability was initially exposed. Based on CNNVD’s statistical average for publishing vulnerabilities with High CVSS\nscores (90 percent of High vulnerabilities are published within 20 days), the breadth of its source material, and the limited\ntext in the entry itself, this is another case where the extended delay in publication is unexplainable.\nIt is likely that CVE-2016-10136 and CVE-2016-10138 are another example of MSS leveraging its authority over CNNVD on\nbehalf of its operations. This publication lag of 236 days was the longest delay for a vulnerability published by CNNVD. We\ndo not believe that these vulnerabilities, the links they might have to Chinese government surveillance, and the eight\nmonth publication delay are coincidences. The systems with these backdoors were overwhelmingly located in China ,\nCNNVD is largely followed and consumed by Chinese businesses and citizens, and the MSS has a mission to collect\ndomestic intelligence. While we cannot determine with certainty that the MSS was exploiting this vulnerability, we believe\nthis is another example of likely MSS interference in the CNNVD publication process.\nGroups of CVEs Within the Outliers\nFurther, CVE-2017-0199 was part of a group of vulnerabilities  published and patched by Microsoft on April 11, 2017. Some\nof the other CVE contained in this April 11 update included CVE-2017-0158, CVE-2017-0164, CVE-2017-0167, CVE-2017-0181,\nand CVE-2017-0207. CVE-2017-0164 and CVE-2017-0167 both had low CVSS score (3.5 or less) and were published by CNNVD\nin 36 days, while the other four had medium or high CVSS scores and were not published for an additional 21 days (57 days\ntotal).\nAmong these outliers, we identi ed two other groups of vulnerabilities where CNNVD handled publication in a similar\nmanner. On April 5, 2017, Cisco released security notes about multiple vulnerabilities , all of which were published by NVD\nwithin two days, but in CNNVD 42, and then 148 days later. The low CVSS score vulnerabilities were published in 42 days,\nand the medium and high vulnerabilities in 148 days.\nTimeline of Cisco vulnerabilities released on April 5.\nThe other group was a series of Linux vulnerabilities, published in an Android Security Bulletin  on April 1, 2017. Again, each\nCVE in this set was published by NVD within four days, but published by CNNVD in 44 to 156 days, with the higher CVSS\nscore vulnerabilities being published later.\nWe believe this dissimilar treatment of vulnerabilities within each group of CVEs is another indicator that CNNVD has a\ndi erent process for publishing vulnerabilities that may have operational use for the MSS.\nCVEs Exploited by Chinese APT Groups\nTo address the second question regarding how CNNVD treats vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited by malware\nlinked to Chinese APT groups, we examined CVEs that were exploited by 15 di erent pieces of malware. These included:\n9002RAT\nBS2005\nDerusbi\nFakeM\nPirpi\nPoisonIvy\nSakula\nSykipot\nSysget\nZeroT\nZoxPNG\nBBSRat\nZxShell\nIsSpace/N og\nTidePool\nNote: These malware represent only a subset of exploits used by Chinese APT groups. We selected these because they represent a\nwide range of exploits, from more niche to broader, publicly accessible tools.\nThe 15 pieces of malware exploited 32 di erent vulnerabilities (full list is in Appendix A). Thirty-one of these vulnerabilities\nwere published by NVD  rst; the only one published  rst by CNNVD was CVE-2007-0671. NVD published 31 vulnerabilities\nwithin one day of disclosure, the other was published three days later.\nCNNVD published 93 percent (30) of these exploited CVEs within six days of disclosure. The other two vulnerabilities were\npublished after 12 (CVE-2013-1347, utilized by PoisonIvy) and 56 days (CVE-2017-0199, utilized by ZeroT, also see section\nabove).\nGiven that CNNVD beats NVD to publication 43 percent of the time, we should expect to see about 13 of these vulnerabilities\nreported by CNNVD  rst, however, we see only one. That one represents only three percent of these CVEs and is far outside of the\nstatistical norm.\nAs a comparison, we studied 13 CVEs exploited by malware linked to the NSA-associated Equation Group. Although a\nsmaller sample size, it proves a useful foil in that 11 of the vulnerabilities were reported by NVD  rst, two by CNNVD.\nAll CVEs were reported by NVD within three days, except one, CVE-2017-0176, which was published after nine days (CNNVD\npublished this vulnerability in one day). This vulnerability was exploited by the Equation Group tool ESTEEMAUDIT.\nThe other vulnerability published  rst by CNNVD was CVE-2017-8487. CNNVD published within one day, NVD published the\nnext day (within two).\nAmong these Equation Group-related CVEs, NVD beat CNNVD to publication for 85 percent — much closer to its\npublication rate for Chinese APT associated CVEs (97 percent) than to the broad trend of 48 percent (NVD beats CNNVD to\npublication 52 percent of the time).\nOutlook\nIt is always di cult to identify the hand of an intelligence service in an in uence operation. In this research, we studied\nnearly 300 di erent CVEs that fell outside of the statistical norms in an attempt to identify undue in uence upon the\nvulnerability reporting process in China. What we discovered were numerous clear examples of unexplainable behavior in\nvulnerability reporting by CNNVD, and cases where we believe the MSS likely have interfered to delay publication. We\nfurther revealed that CNNVD is essentially a shell; it has a website but appears to be separate from CNITSEC and the MSS\nin name only.\nThis data points to a larger conclusion, that China has a vulnerability evaluation process in which High-threat\nvulnerabilities are likely evaluated for their utility in intelligence operations before publication by CNNVD. Our analysis of\nthese critical statistical deviations highlights why an intelligence service should not manage the vulnerability publication\nprocess — it is impossible for an intelligence service to equally uphold the mandates for both vulnerability reporting\n(transparency) and intelligence operations (secrecy). Our analysis of this dataset demonstrates that in China, one mandate\nis typically sacri ced — that of transparency.\nWhen malicious cyber actors and security teams are racing to exploit or patch vulnerabilities, having access to the latest\ninformation is critical, but is only one part of the story. Speed is important, but content is as well.\nBroadly, CNNVD is still faster to report vulnerabilities of all severities than NVD, however, the content of the publications\ncan be inferior, and there is likely interference by the MSS in delaying the publication of operationally useful CVEs.\nCompanies and individual users should not rely on a single datasource for vulnerability reporting, no matter how quickly\nthe source publishes. As our research has demonstrated, CNNVD is typically faster to publication than NVD, but NVD\nusually contains better content, references, and remediation information. Both databases are useful and have their own\nindividual strengths and weaknesses and are valuable resources for vulnerability reporting.\nTo help analysts and security teams get ahead of vulnerability disclosures, Recorded Future collects information from a\nbroad range of sources (including the CNNVD) and alerts on new vulnerabilities in real time. Additionally, users can search\nfor new critical and pre-NVD vulnerabilities through a customized Threat View.
