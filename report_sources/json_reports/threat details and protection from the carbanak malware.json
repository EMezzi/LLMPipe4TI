Banks are networks that hold\nvery critical financial data, which makes them perfect targets for cyber attacks.\nAccording to reports, the attackers were able to infiltrate 100 banks located in various countries, including Russia, USA,\nGermany, China, and Ukraine. Here are the high-level details on how the infiltration was executed:\nSpear phishing emails  were sent to the banks’ employees, containing either an exploit  (CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2013-\n3906, CVE- 2014-1761) or a malicious CPL file .\nBoth the exploit and the malicious CPL file drop the Carbanak malware into the system. Carbanak is a backdoor\ndesigned to execute various commands  including logging keystrokes, taking screenshots, and checking for specific\nbanking applications such as fund transfer software. \nThe attackers used Carbanak to  move laterally within the network  through remote administration tools to reach\ntarget systems, which are those that involve processing bank accounts. Once target systems are reached, the\nattackers record videos of the affected user’s operation to be familiar with the victim’s workflow. The attackers then\nused this information and access to manipulate bank records and transfer funds into their accounts without being\ndetected. \nThis attack is notable for its usage of techniques that aimed to mimic normal activities within the network in order to\nevade detection. It raises the importance of having a security strategy that is designed to see through these techniques\nand detect malicious activities.\nDETAILS\nCustom Defense Solutions\nTrend Micro Custom Defense employs a comprehensive 360-degree detection to minimize the opportunities for a targeted\nattack through its family of security solutions.\nTrend Micro Deep Discovery  provides the network-wide visibility and intelligence that is the cornerstone of the Custom\nDefense solution against so-called APTs (advanced persistent threats) and targeted attacks such as this one.\nFor the Carbanak attack scenario, Deep Discovery could detect the attack at several different points in the sequence of\nevents:\nTrend Micro Deep Discovery Email Inspector  is able to detect the spear-phishing emails sent by attackers to the\nbanks’ employees as the initial step to breach traditional security defenses, establish a foothold, and commence a\ntargeted attack. Deep Discovery Email Inspector has email inspection capabilities that discover malicious content,\nattachments, and URL links that pass unnoticed through standard email secu\nTrend Micro Deep Discovery Analyzer  is able to detect even previously unknown threats by analyzing a broad range\nof file types, sizes, and sources using customizable sandbox environments that attackers design and build to match\norganization’s desktop and device platforms. It enhances the malware detection capabilities of all existing security\ninvestments by giving the ability to share detected and analyzed threat insight, enabling security infrastructure to\nprevent malicious communication, websites, applications, malware and attacker behavior from spreading.\n \nTrend Micro Deep Discovery Inspector  is able to identify suspicious activities anywhere on   network, such as those\nexecuted by Carbanak in moving laterally through the network and connecting to its command and control. Deep\nDiscovery Inspector is also able to proactively detect the traffic triggered by the remote administration tool used by\nattackers: Deep Discovery Inspector is capable of monitoring traffic across all ports and more than 80 protocols and\napplications to detect threats that are purposely built to evade traditional security defenses. It also features Trend\nMicro Advanced Threat Scan Engine that is able to detect the malicious email attachments with embedded exploit\ncode through its forward-looking heuristic rules.\nOnce detected, Deep Discovery can provide the organization with both local intelligence and global threat intelligence from\nthe Trend Micro Smart Protection Network to identify and assess the risk of the malware, communications or activities\nfound. \nFinally, Deep Discovery provides automated security signature updates and alert notifications to the organizations’s other\nsecurity products to enable a full Custom Defense that stops the attack from progressing further. Examples include: \nProviding IOC (Indicators of Compromise) information including C&C blacklists to both Trend Micro and third party\nsecurity products \nSIEM alerting and full IOC sharing\nOptionally invoking Trend Micro Network VirusWall Enforcer to isolate endpoints known to be infected\nEndpoint Protection\nProperly-configured endpoint solutions can ensure the prevention of Carbanak from coming into the machine or network.\nComponents of OfficeScan Corporate Edition (OSCE) such as SmartScan , Web Reputation Service , Behavior\nMonitoring , and Smart Feedback offer the best protection against Carbanak by detecting the malicious files.Rating:\n1 found this helpful\nCategory:\nRemove a Malware / Virus\nSolution Id:\n1107858\nBusiness  SupportHome & Home Office Support Business Support Partner Portal TrendMicro.com Product Logins Europe\nSign in to\nMy Support\nThreat Help & Research Renewals & Registration Contact Support Technical Support \n Enter your search term\n \n Worry-Free Business Security/Services (WFBS/WFBS-SVC)  is also equipped with technologies to detect and remove\nCarbanak in the machine or network \nMail Scanning Solution\nEmail played a big part in the delivery of Carbanak, making it an important vector to protect from attackers. \nTrend Micro Hosted Email Security  offers technologies such as the connection-level and content-based reputation\nfiltering, designed best to block threats that arrive via email.\nTrend Micro InterScan Messaging Security Virtual Appliance leverages the Trend Micro Advanced Threat Scan\nEngine in order to detect document exploits such as the ones used in this attack.\nDid this article help you?FEEDBACK\nYesYes  \nNoNo\nContact Support\n Download Center\n Product Documentation\n Support Policies\n Product Vulnerability\n Ideas Exchange\n \nCopyright © 2020 Trend Micro Incorporated.
