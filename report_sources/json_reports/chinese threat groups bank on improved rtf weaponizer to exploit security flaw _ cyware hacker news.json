As part of their analysis of this weaponized script, it was found that the updated version was used solely to exploit CVE-2018-0798 - a\nstack buffer overflow flaw in Microsoft’s Equation Editor.\nThe earlier version of this “Royal Road” weaponizer was used to exploit two remote code execution vulnerabilities(CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-\n0802) in the same Equation Editor. Anomali researchers suggest that the groups now relied on CVE-2018-0798 due to its ‘reliability’ in all\nversions of Equation Editor.\nThe big picture\nMalware samples analyzed  by the researchers were attributed to five Chinese threat actor groups. They are Conimes, KeyBoy, Emissary\nPanda, Rancor, and Temp.Trident.\nThe campaigns using the improved RTF weaponizer were discovered from June 25, 2019, onwards.\nThe earlier version of the weaponizer was used for approximately one year, starting from December 2017. After this period, it was\nreportedly used by other threat actors indicating that the creator of this weaponizer was selling it to others.\nAnomali researchers also came across various exploitation techniques that leveraged CVE-2018-0798 to drop malicious payloads.\nSome of these techniques included OLE package objects, DLL Sideloading and dropping malicious ‘.wll’ files in Windows startup folders.\nWorth noting\nThe researchers indicate the reason on why threat actors opted for CVE-2018-0798 exploitation. “CVE-2017-11882 is only exploitable on an\nunpatched version prior to its fix, and CVE-2018-0802 is only exploitable on the version released to fix CVE-2017-11882. In contrast, a threat\nactor utilizing CVE-2018-0798 has a higher chance of success because it is not limited by version,” they said.\nRANCOR Microsoft Office Equation Editor Weaponized RTF Document Chinese APT Groups KeyBoy\nREAD PREVIOUS\nFake Android app serves bogus\n‘Samsung firmware updates ...\nMalware and VulnerabilitiesREAD NEXT\nLenovo servers contained major\nsecurity vulnerabilities\nMalware and Vulnerabilities\nNews and Updates, Hacker News -\ndiscussWrite to us at \ncontact@cyware.comFollow us on \n  \nVisit Us \nCyware Labs, 1460 Broadway, New York, NY 10036\n \nAlerts Events DCR Explore Cyware Products   \n Search Topic, Events \n "
