A\nlongstanding cyberespionage campaign has been targeting mainly Japanese organizations with\nits own custom-developed malware (Backdoor.Daserf). The group, known to Symantec as Tick,\nhas maintained a low profile, appearing to be active for at least 10 years prior to discovery.\nIn its most recent campaign, Tick employed spear-phishing emails and compromised a number\nof Japanese websites in order to infect a new wave of victims. The group is highly selective in\nits approach and only appears to deploy its full range of tools once it establishes that the\ncompromised organization is an intended target. Tick also uses a range of hacktools to map the\nvictim’s network and attempt to escalate privileges further.\nDaserf’s main purpose is information stealing and the Trojan is capable of gathering\ninformation from infected computers and relaying it back to attacker-controlled servers. Tick’s\nmost recent attacks have concentrated on the technology, aquatic engineering, and\nbroadcasting sectors in Japan.\nRecent attacks\nSymantec discovered the most recent wave of Tick attacks in July 2015, when the group\ncompromised three different Japanese websites with a Flash (.swf) exploit to mount watering\nhole attacks. Visitors to these websites were infected with a downloader known as Gofarer\n(Downloader.Gofarer). Gofarer collects information about the compromised computer and then\ndownloads and installs Daserf.\nTick also used spear-phishing emails in these recent attacks. While Symantec did not find the\nemails themselves, it did identify the use of an exploit designed to take advantage of a\nvulnerability in Microsoft Office documents (CVE-2014-4114). This was used to distribute\nmalware in addition to the watering hole activity.\nTick under the microscope\nDaserf appears to be custom-developed for use in Tick’s cyberespionage campaigns. Once\ninstalled, it establishes a remote connection to Tick’s command and control server, providing\nthe attacker with access to the compromised computer.\nFig1_35.png\nFigure 1. Chain of infection seen in recent Japanese attacks\nOnce the malware is installed on a targeted computer, the attackers attempt to enumerate the\nnetwork and escalate their privilege level. To do this, Tick uses a number of publicly available\nhacktools such as Mimikatz, GSecdump, and Windows Credential Editor. The tools are\ndownloaded and deployed to the original install directory previously created by the malware.\nTick’s primary objective appears to be the theft of sensitive information from targeted Japanese\norganizations. To date, Symantec has observed the group attempting to steal emails and\ndocuments such as PowerPoint presentations.\nLow-profile threat\nThe Daserf Trojan employs a number of tactics to avoid detection. Once collected, the stolen\ndata is hidden in password-protected .rar archives.\nDaserf also uses file and folder names related to legitimate programs often found in Windows\nenvironments in order to blend in. Observed folder names include HP, Intel, Adobe, and\nperflogs and folders are generally created in either the root drive or the Application Data or\nProgram Files folders. File names used in recent attacks include adobe.exe, adobe_sl.exe,\nintel.exe, and intellog.exe.\nCommand and control servers\nTick uses compromised web servers to distribute malware and, in some instances, for its\ncommand and control (C&C) infrastructure. However, in most cases, it relies on its own\ninfrastructure for C&C purposes.\nIn its most recent campaigns, the group registered the domains used for C&C servers days\nafter the malware was compiled. For example, one of the variants of Daserf used was compiled\non July 8, 2015. This sample was seen contacting the C&C domain www[.]dreamsig[.]com,\nwhich was first registered on July 13, 2015, five days after the compilation date. This pattern\noccurred in multiple Daserf samples.\nAnother interesting aspect of the communication between the malware and the C&C\ninfrastructure is how the malware changes the URL from a randomly chosen variable selected\nfrom a predefined list.\nPREDEFINED LIST FROM DASERF MD5:\n765017E16842C9EB6860A7E9F711B0DB\nrjdyw.asp\nxszgj.asp\ndheyf.asp\nejdhf.asp\ngxbne.asp\nswetf.asp\nqgfhr.asp\nwhjdh.asp\nzgfer.asp\ncshyr.asp\nfxkle.asp\ntmwry.asp\nviksr.asp\nycghw.asp\nTable 1. An example of how a Daserf sample uses a predefined list of URLs embedded in the\nmalware\nSymantec identified multiple C&C domains used by Tick. Unfortunately, Tick frequently used\neither privacy protection services or domain brokers to mask registration information. These\ntactics are used to make discovery and attribution more difficult.\nC&C DOMAIN PARENT HASH\ncharlie-harada[.]com 122652ca6ef719f8ba2d8d412ea184fe\nisozaki.sakura.ne[.]jp 4601e75267d0dcfe4256c43f45ec470a\nwww.aucsellers[.]com 7ec173d469c2aa7a3a15acb03214256c\nwww.lunwe[.]com 8d5bf506e55ab736f4c018d15739e352\nc-saika[.]jp3fa5965a1de2c095de38f22f0645af3e\nb33f4b8e776b94dc48c234ce9897cf74\nkcm-store[.]com 63fe9f06068823b02b925e4a74a57db0\nhtpc[.]jpa629926313ee12163e1bdd2bb633e0e2\nd3031438d80913f21ec6d3078dc77068\nrlsolar[.]jp d3031438d80913f21ec6d3078dc77068\nTable 2. Examples of Tick C&C domains and associated MD5 hashes\nStolen digital certificates used in selected cases\nThe majority of the malware analyzed was not digitally signed. However, a small percentage was\nsigned with a stolen digital certificate. It is unclear why the certificate was used so sparingly,\nsince signed malware would receive a greater level of trust and reduce the risk of detection.\nIt is possible that the certificate was used against a target that had a secure environment\nwhich may have required binaries to be signed in order to interact with the operating system.\nThe issuer of the certificate has been informed of its misuse and confirmed that it would be\nrevoked.\nFig2_24.png\nFigure 2 . The stolen digital certificate used to sign Tick malware\nTargets\nThe use of compromised websites to infect victims results in unintentional infections, making it\ndifficult to identify the motives of the attacker. By searching for evidence of post-infection\nactivity, Symantec identified seven organizations where Tick had mounted persistent post-\ncompromise attacks. These organizations were primarily large Japanese technology,\nengineering, and media firms.\nFig3_20.png\nFigure 3 . Daserf infections by region\nThe seven organizations therefore appear to be Tick’s intended targets. In addition to seeing\npost-compromise tools used in these attacks, the length of time the attackers were active on\nthe networks provided additional evidence that these were high-value targets. The longest time\nTick was active in a victim’s environment was 18 months. The average timeframe was five\nmonths and the number of infected hosts in a victim’s network ranged from 3 to 15 systems.\nConclusion\nTick has left a trail of evidence indicating that its activity began as early as 2006. In earlier\nattacks, the group used malicious Microsoft Word documents to infect victims, with\ncompromised websites being added to the mix as a more recent attack vector.\nTick appears to be a well-organized group, with the funding and capability to develop and\nupdate its malware. It has the ability to compromise legitimate infrastructure to use for malware\ndistribution and has access to stolen digital certificates to sign its malware when needed. Tick\nprimarily uses purchased infrastructure for its C&C servers and has been able to stay off the\nradar since 2006.\nTick exhibits all the hallmarks of an advanced cyberespionage group. The long lifespan of the\ngroup, as well as the consistent targeted attacks against specific industries, support this theory.\nThe individuals or organization behind Tick’s operations has an interest in Japanese\ntechnology along with Japanese media and broadcasting organizations. While Tick’s tactics\nmay change over time, the group’s history indicates that its focus will continue to be a narrow\nrange of targets, mainly in Japan.\nSource:https://www.symantec.com/\nON: APRIL 30, 2016  / IN: DATA SECURITY , MALWARE , VULNERABILITIES  / TAGGED:  JAPAN. , TROJANTICK CYBERESPIONAGE GROUP ZEROS IN ON\nJAPAN\nShare this...\nGET XSS BUG BOUNTY WITH\nXSSFINDER\nSEE HOW TO SEARCH\nUSERNAME, PASSWORDS,\nCONFIGURATION FILES,\nEMAILS, OPEN CAMERAS ON\nGOOGLE\nNEW LINUX FOR CYBER\nFORENSICS AND\nINVESTIGATORS – CSI LINUX\nAlisa Esage\nWorking as a cyber security solutions architect, Alisa focuses on bug bounty and\nnetwork security.
