Eight other compromised sites were\nalso reported to be similarly compromised with the data suggesting that this campaign began in mid-\nMarch.\nThe campaign appeared to exploit visitors to these sites via the recent CVE-2012-4792 vulnerability, however\nCrowdStrike recently learned from other researchers that the exploit leveraged appears to be a zero-day.\nSuccessful compromise resulted in infection with Poison Ivy. The sample observed infecting visitors to the\nDepartment of Labor website was conime.exe file (MD5: 8f287f2bc83a8df06a39020f25cd91da) with a build\ntimestamp of April 6, 2013 at 17:53:18 UTC. The RAT attempted to connect to a C2 server at\nmicrosoftupdate.ns1.name on TCP ports 80, 443, 53, and 8080.  This domain has been seen pointing at two\nIPs: 173.254.229.176 and 13.58.46.78. It uses a password of “japan092wsx$RFV ” to authenticate itself at the\nbackend and installs a mutex named “)!xdrA.I4. ”\nVictimology\nAnalysis of logs from the malicious infrastructure used in this campaign revealed the IP addresses of\nvisitors to the compromised sites which showed hits from 37 different countries.  Here is the breakdown of\nthese IP addresses by region:\nIt is important to note that the data analyzed showed IP addresses before exploit code was run against the\nvisitors’ machines.  It is possible that exploit code was not successful against all visitors to these sites,\ntherefore all visitors may not have had their machines compromised.\nTargeting\nThe legitimate sites compromised to deliver malicious code in this campaign give an indication into targets\nof interest.  The specific Department of Labor website that was compromised provides information on a\ncompensation program for energy workers who were exposed to uranium.  Likely targets of interest for this\nsite include energy-related US government entities, energy companies, and possibly companies in the\nextractive sector. \nBased on the other compromised sites other targeted entities are likely to include those interested in labor,\ninternational health and political issues, as well as entities in the defense sector.\nDEEP PANDA\nCrowdStrike is aware of multiple reports linking this activity to the adversary CrowdStrike refers to as DEEP\nPANDA. At this time, CrowdStrike cannot verify this connection due to the C2 server being offline. There is a\npublicly available report  on the CrowdStrike website detailing the indicators associated with the DEEP\nPANDA adversary. We continue to analyze this incident to verify the possible attribution of the DOL Strategic\nWeb Compromise to the DEEP PANDA adversary.\nThe following Snort signatures will enable you to detect the Poison Ivy RAT used in this attack.\nalert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET any (msg: “[CrowdStrike] Poison Ivy Plugin\n– japan092”; flow: established, from_server; content: “|f2 b0 80 bf de 19 78 54 2b\nc7 85 86 97 6e 84 db b7 25 65 cc 16 02 d9 0e 9c be 3d 79|”; offset: 4; depth: 32; \nsid: x; rev: 1; )\nalert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg: “[CrowdStrike] Poison Ivy Victim\nKeep-Alive  – japan092”; flow: established, to_server; dsize: 48; content: “|0f 07\n06 1c 02 bc 42 51 ab ce 22 a7 a2 15 15 0c|”; offset: 0; depth: 16; sid: x; rev: 1; )\nalert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET any (msg: “[CrowdStrike] Poison Ivy\nController Keep-Alive – japan092”; flow: established, from_server; dsize: 48;\ncontent: “|f2 82 18 f2 08 53 2e 19  24 d5 8b 54 44 73 55 87|”; offset: 0; depth: 16;\nsid: x; rev: 1; )\nBe sure to follow @CrowdStrike  on Twitter as we continue to provide updates on this topic.
