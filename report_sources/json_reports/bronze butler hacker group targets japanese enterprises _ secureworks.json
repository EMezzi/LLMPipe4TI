BRONZE BUTLER's operations suggest a long-standing intent to exﬁltrate\nintellectual property and other conﬁdential data from Japanese organizations. Intrusions observed by CTU™\nresearchers indicate a focus on networks involved in critical infrastructure, heavy industry, manufacturing,\nand international relations.Tick\nCTU researchers divided the  about this threat group into two sections:  and\n. Executives can use the strategic assessment of the ongoing threat to determine how to reduce risk\nto their organization's mission and critical assets. Computer network defenders can use the tactical\ninformation gathered from incident response investigations and research to reduce the time and effort\nassociated with responding to the threat group's activities.threat intelligence strategic\ntactical\nKey points\nAnalysis of BRONZE BUTLER's operations, targeting, and capability led CTU researchers to assess that it\nis likely that the group is located in the PRC.\nThe group has used spearphishing, strategic web compromises (SWCs), and an exploit of a zero-day\nvulnerability to compromise targeted systems.\nAfter exﬁltrating targeted data from a network, BRONZE BUTLER typically deletes evidence of its\nactivities. However, it maintains access to compromised environments when possible, periodically\nrevisiting compromised sites to identify new opportunities for data exﬁltration.\nThe threat actors seemingly have the capability to develop and deploy their own proprietary malware\ntools. The group's command and control (C2) protocols are encrypted, presenting challenges for\nnetwork defenders and incident responders.\nStrategic threat intelligence\nAnalysis of a threat group's targeting, origin, and competencies can determine which organizations could be\nat risk. This information can help organizations make strategic defensive decisions regarding this threat.\nIntent\nCTU analysis indicates that BRONZE BUTLER primarily targets organizations located in Japan. The threat\ngroup has sought unauthorized access to networks of organizations associated with critical infrastructure,\nheavy industry, manufacturing, and international relations. Secureworks analysts have observed BRONZE\nBUTLER exﬁltrating the following categories of data:\nIntellectual property related to technology and development\nProduct speciﬁcation\nSensitive business and sales-related information\nNetwork and system conﬁguration ﬁles\nEmail messages and meeting minutes\nThe focus on intellectual property, product details, and corporate information suggests that the group seeks\ninformation that they believe might be of value to competing organizations. The diverse targeting suggests\nthat BRONZE BUTLER may be tasked by multiple teams or organizations with varying priorities.\nAttribution\nThe following characteristics led CTU researchers to assess that it is likely that BRONZE BUTLER originates in\nthe PRC:\nUse of T-SMB Scan tools published on a Chinese developer's website\nChinese characters in the installation service name of an early version of the xxmm backdoor\n links between BRONZE BUTLER's Daserf tool and the PRC-based ,\nand a decrease in BRONZE BUTLER activity during PRC national holidaysDocumented NCPH hacking group\nPRC-based cyberespionage groups have historically sought intellectual property and economic intelligence\nfrom competing economies to deliver information which can provide a competitive advantage domestically.\nThe demand for this type of intelligence gathering could be inﬂuenced by China’s ambitious \n.economic\ngrowth goals\nCapability\nBRONZE BUTLER has used a broad range of publicly available (Mimikatz and gsecdump) and proprietary\n(Daserf and Datper) tools. It appears to have been sufﬁciently resourced to continuously develop and\nreplace its proprietary tools over a long period of time. The threat actors developed remote access tools\nand malware that generate and use encrypted C2 communication, presumably to complicate detection and\nmitigation. The threat actors are also ﬂuent in Japanese, crafting phishing emails in native Japanese and\noperating successfully within a Japanese-language environment.\nHow Much Risk Does\nYour Organization\nFace?\nGet your cybersecurity risk score\nLEARN MORE     Products Services Solutions Research Resources CompanyEmergency Incident Response Report a Conﬁrmed or Potential Breach?

A large percentage\nof this infrastructure is hosted in Japan, possibly to avoid scrutiny from security agencies that monitor\ninternational communications. The group periodically changes the C2 IP addresses and domains for each\ncompromised network, which can limit the effectiveness of blacklisting the group's infrastructure. The group\nalso supplements its operational infrastructure with access to compromised websites. The breadth and\ncomplexity of BRONZE BUTLER's operational infrastructure suggests that the group may have access to a\ndedicated infrastructure acquisition function.\nThe group has demonstrated the ability to identify a signiﬁcant zero-day vulnerability within a popular\nJapanese corporate tool and then use scan-and-exploit techniques to indiscriminately compromise Japanese\nInternet-facing enterprise systems. The threat actors appear to use these initial footholds to select\norganizations of interest for further compromise. The group is attentive to changes in compromised networks\nand proactively attempts to avoid scrutiny from network defenders by modifying tools and methods. It has\nremained undetected in several compromised networks for up to ﬁve years.\nTactical threat intelligence\nIncident response engagements have given CTU researchers insight into the tools and tactics that BRONZE\nBUTLER employs during intrusions.\nTools\nCTU researchers have observed BRONZE BUTLER leveraging the following tools that appear to be exclusive\nto the group. Figure 1 shows the threat group's use of some proprietary tools between 2012 and 2017.\n \nFigure 1. Timeline of malware used by BRONZE BUTLER. (Source: Secureworks)\nDaserf — This backdoor has the functionality of a remote shell and can be used to execute commands,\nupload and download data, capture screenshots, and log keystrokes. It uses RC4 encryption and\ncustom Base64 encoding to obfuscate HTTP trafﬁc. CTU researchers identiﬁed two versions of Daserf\nwritten in Visual C and Delphi. Analysis of the compile timestamps suggest that Delphi version is the\nsuccessor to the Visual C version. CTU analysis suggests that the following registry entry is an\nindication of a Delphi-based Daserf infection:\nKey: HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\nValue: MMID = <random hex string>\nDatper — BRONZE BUTLER likely created this Delphi-coded RAT to replace Daserf. Datper uses an RC4-\nencrypted conﬁguration to obfuscate HTTP trafﬁc.\nxxmm (also known as Minzen) — This RAT and likely successor to Daserf AES-encrypts HTTP\ncommunications using a one-time encryption key. As of this publication, BRONZE BUTLER demonstrates\na preference for concurrently using Datper and xxmm in its operations. CTU researchers identiﬁed an\nxxmm builder for xxmm (see Figure 2), which suggests that the threat actors customize the xxmm\nmalware settings based on the target.\nFigure 2. Customizable settings in an xxmm builder. (Source: Secureworks)\nxxmm downloader (also known as KVNDM) — This simple downloader's code is similar to the main xxmm\npayload.\nGofarer — This downloader uses the “Mozilla/4.0+(compatible;+MSIE+8.0;+Windows+NT+6.1;+Trident/4.0;”\nUser-Agent in its HTTP communication (see Figure 3).\nFigure 3. Gofarer HTTP GET request. (Source: Secureworks)\nMSGet — This persistent downloader uses a dead-drop resolver (DDR) to download and execute\nanother malicious payload. MSGet typically downloads encoded binaries from hard-coded URLs. After\ndecoding, MSGet saves the binary as %TEMP%\\ms exe and executes it. <hex string>.\nDGet — This simple downloader (see Figure 4) is similar to the  web server retrieval tool. wget\n \n Figure 4. DGet usage. (Source: Secureworks)\nScreen Capture Tool— This tool can capture the desktop of a victim's system (see Figure 5).\n \nFigure 5. Screen Capture Tool usage. (Source: Secureworks)\nRarStar — This custom tool uploads RAR archives to a speciﬁed URL as POST data (see Figure 6).\nRarStar encodes the POST data using Base64 and a custom XOR algorithm.\n \nFigure 6. RarStar HTTP POST request. (Source: Secureworks)\nBRONZE BUTLER has also used the following publicly available tools, but CTU researchers determined that\nthe group modiﬁed most of them. Analysis of the ﬁles identiﬁed the use of multiple packers, adjusted\nfunctionality in the source code, and recompilation.\nMimikatz — This tool retrieves passwords from memory.\nWindows Credential Editor (WCE) — This tool obtains passwords from memory.\ngsecdump — This tool obtains passwords from memory.\nT-SMB Scan — This SMB scanning tool was originally published on a Chinese program-sharing website\n(pudn.com). BRONZE BUTLER removed its help message functionality.\nWinRAR — This tool extracts tools for lateral movement and compresses data for exﬁltration.\nTactics, techniques, and procedures\nIncident response engagements have given CTU researchers insight into the tactics that BRONZE BUTLER\nemploys during intrusions.\nDelivery\nBRONZE BUTLER uses spearphishing emails and SWCs to compromise target networks, often leveraging\nFlash. The group has used phishing emails with Flash animation attachments to download and execute\nDaserf malware, and has also  Flash exploits for SWC attacks. leveraged\nCTU researchers observed BRONZE BUTLER using compromised websites, typically located in Japan and\nSouth Korea, as part of its attack infrastructure. The group has demonstrated a capability to compromise\nand leverage a large number of websites in its campaigns. Based on the large quantity of C2 servers and\nvarying IP addresses used during the same operation, the group also appears to purchase attack\ninfrastructure. BRONZE BUTLER has leveraged a distinct attack infrastructure for different targets, suggesting\nthat the group proactively segments operational infrastructure to minimize the risk of attribution by security\nresearchers.\nExploitation\nWhile investigating a 2016 intrusion, Secureworks incident responders identiﬁed BRONZE BUTLER exploiting a\nthen-unpatched remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2016-7836) in , a popular\nJapanese product used to manage an organization's IT assets. SKY Corporation  the vulnerability\non December 21, 2016, but entries in the victim's SKYSEA Client View default log (CtlCli.log) show that the\ngroup had exploited the issue since at least June 2016 (see Figure 7).SKYSEA Client View\nannounced\nFigure 7. SKYSEA Client View log entries resulting from CVE-2016-7836 exploitation. (Source: Secureworks)\nThis vulnerability can be exposed when a portable connection device, such as an LTE USB modem, is\nconnected to corporate devices. It is common for remote Japanese workers to use portable connection\ndevices to connect to the Internet and corporate VPNs. However, some of these devices assign the ISP's\nglobal IP address to the connected laptop. Threat actors could exploit the vulnerability to impersonate the\nmanagement console, and compromise the laptop's SKYSEA agent that is exposed on the Internet.\nBRONZE BUTLER conducted periodic Internet scans to ﬁnd vulnerable hosts. CTU researchers veriﬁed that\nsome exploited systems were not subject to further compromise or lateral movement. This outcome suggests\nthat the group may deploy malware to all identiﬁed vulnerable systems, but then pursues speciﬁc targets\nafter validating the system's association with organizations of interest.\nInstallation\nThe threat actors use multiple custom downloaders that rely on executable ﬁles (Gofarer, MSGet, and xxmm\ndownloader), PowerShell scripts, or VBS/VBE scripts. These downloaders use HTTP trafﬁc, download an\nadditional payload such as Daserf, Datper, or xxmm in a compressed and encoded format, and typically\nexecute the downloaded malware after decoding the ﬁle.\nCTU researchers identiﬁed the code in Figure 8 within a downloader program. This code inserts ‘0'\ncharacters at the end of the executable ﬁle to inﬂate the ﬁle size to 50-100 MB, likely to evade antivirus\nsoftware detection. When analyzing BRONZE BUTLER incidents, CTU researchers observed several antivirus\ntools skip scanning of inﬂated ﬁles.\nFigure 8. Downloader malware code used to inﬂate payload ﬁle size. (Source: Secureworks)\n CTU researchers also observed BRONZE BUTLER copying downloader source code to a ﬁle (do.cs) on a\ncompromised system and then compiling it into an executable ﬁle (do.exe). The decrypted proxy log shows\nthe threat actors compiling custom code on the compromised system (see Figure 9).\nFigure 9. Decrypted proxy log showing compilation of custom code on compromised endpoint. (Source:\nSecureworks)\nCommand and control (C2) communication\nDaserf, Datper, and xxmm communicate with C2 servers via HTTP, encrypting commands and data using the\nalgorithms in Table 1. The tools use an Internet Explorer component to bypass proxy authentication as long\nas the compromised system communicates during the authorized times deﬁned by the proxy server.\nMalware HTTP methods Encryption algorithm\nDaserf (Visual C) POST RC4\nDaserf (Delphi) GET (POST for large data) RC4\nDatper GET (POST for large data) RC4\nxxmm GET (POST for large data) RC4\nAES with one-time encryption key\nTable 1. Daserf, Datper, and xxmm encryption algorithms.\nBRONZE BUTLER uses unique C2 servers for each tool and changes C2 servers periodically. A large\nproportion of the group's C2 servers are hosted in Japan. The presence of certain URL patterns in proxy\nlogs (see Table 2) can reveal BRONZE BUTLER activity.\nMalware URL pattern User-Agent\nDaserf http:// .gif\nhttp:// .asp\nhttp:// .php?id= &\n=<domain/path>\n<domain/path>\n<domain/path> <8-digit hex string> <4 lowercase\ncharacters> <string similar to Base64-encoded string>Mozilla/4.0 (compatible;\nMSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0;\nSV1)\nInternet Explorer version\nnumber may vary\nDatper http:// .php?< =\n1\nhttp:// .php? =\n2<domain/path> lowercase characters> <16-digit hex\nstring> <random string>\n<domain/path> <lowercase characters> <16-digit hex\nstring> <string similar to Base64-encoded string>\nxxmm http:// .php?t0= >&t1= &t2=\n&t3= &t6=\nhttp:// .php?id0= &id1= &id2=\nid3= &id6=\nhttp:// .php?idcard0 idcard1=\n<number>&idcard2 &idcard3= &idcard6=\nhttp:// .php?item0= &item1=\n&item2= &item3= &item6=\nhttp:// .php?ps0= &ps1=\n&ps2= &ps3= &ps6=\nhttp:// .php?h= &o= &w=\n&a= &y=\nhttp:// /id0/ /id1/ /id2/\n/id3/ /id6/ /<domain/path> <8-digit hex string> <number>\n<8-digit hex string> <number> <number>\n<domain/path> <8-digit hex string> <number>\n<8-digit hex string> <number> <number>\n<domain/path> =<8-digit hex string>\n=<8-digit hex string> <number>\n<number>\n<domain/path> <8-digit hex string>\n<number> <8-digit hex string> <number>\n<number>\n<domain/path> <8-digit hex string>\n<number> <8-digit hex string> <number> <number>\n<domain/path> <8-digit hex string> <number> <8-\ndigit hex string> <number> <number>\n<domain/path> <8-digit hex string> <number> <8-\ndigit hex string> <number> <number> <random ﬁlename>Mozilla/4.0 (compatible;\nMSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0;\nSV1)\nTable 2. URL patterns related to BRONZE BUTLER activity.\nBRONZE BUTLER leverages the remote access capabilities in these tools, often using existing PC vendors'\ndirectories such as C:\\DELL and C:\\HP as working directories in compromised environments. CTU\nresearchers have also observed threat actors using the following working directories:\nC:\\Intel\\\nC:\\Intel\\Logs\\\nC:\\Intel\\ExtremeGraphics\\CUI\\\nC:\\PerfLogs\\Admin\\\nCredential access\nBRONZE BUTLER uses credential theft tools such as Mimikatz and WCE to steal authentication information\nfrom the memory of compromised hosts. Several xxmm samples analyzed by CTU researchers incorporate\nMimikatz, allowing the threat actors to issue Mimikatz commands directly from xxmm (see Figure 10). In\naddition, xxmm incorporates a UAC bypass tool for privilege escalation prior to stealing passwords.\nFigure 10. Mimikatz command in xxmm. (Source: Secureworks)\nCTU analysis revealed BRONZE BUTLER creating forged Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and Ticket\nGranting Service (TGS) tickets (also called golden and silver tickets, respectively) to maintain administrative\naccess. Figure 11 shows an example of the threat actors creating a golden ticket. \nFigure 11. Kerberos golden ticket created by BRONZE BUTLER. (Source: Secureworks)\nGolden tickets require a username, but the domain controller does not validate that it is legitimate. CTU\n researchers detected BRONZE BUTLER using the following usernames for golden tickets:\nbgtras\nbgtrs\nkkir\nkisetr\nnetkin\norumls\nwert\nHost enumeration\nThe threat actors typically use built-in Windows ping and net commands for network and host enumeration\nactivity to eventually contact the ﬁle-share server (see Figure 12). BRONZE BUTLER also uses the T-SMB\nScan tool to list available SMB hosts, and screen-capture tools to obtain additional information.\nFigure 12. Host enumeration by BRONZE BUTLER. (Source: Secureworks)\nLateral movement\nAfter compromising a host, the threat actors attempt to compromise other connected systems to move\nwithin the network. BRONZE BUTLER typically uses the following procedure for lateral movement:\n1. Use ‘net use' and ‘copy' commands to transfer a malicious ﬁle (such as malware) from the\ncompromised host to a target system on the same network.\n2. Use the ‘net time' command to check the local time on the target system.\n3. Use the ‘at' or ‘schtask' commands to register a scheduled task to be executed in a few\nminutes.\n4. After a few minutes, execute the malicious ﬁle on the system.\nThe malicious ﬁle is typically a batch ﬁle that downloads malware and registers the malware's automatic\nexecution in the registry. Figure 13 shows the scheduled task that executes zrun.bat (a batch ﬁle) using the\nat command.\n \nFigure 13. Scheduled task registration. (Source: Secureworks)\nFigure 14 shows the batch ﬁle (zrun.bat) executing, which adds a registry entry that auto-executes the\nmalware.\nFigure 14. Registry entry added to auto-execute malware. (Source: Secureworks)\nCTU researchers have also observed BRONZE BUTLER giving malware the same name as an existing\ndocument ﬁle on the ﬁle share server to cause users to unwittingly launch and install the malware on\nadditional systems (see Figure 15).\nFigure 15. Malware given the same name as an existing document ﬁle. (Source: Secureworks)\nExﬁltration\nBRONZE BUTLER typically creates a list of ﬁles (i.e., a shopping list) from compromised hosts and ﬁle-share\nservers. If the list is short, the group exﬁltrates the ﬁles directly. For large lists, the threat actors use the\nfollowing procedure:\n1. Use malware to upload the large list of enumerated ﬁles to the C2 server.\n2. Select speciﬁc ﬁles to steal, creating a new list.\n3. Use downloaders or other malware to send the new list to a compromised host.\n4. Use archiving software to collect ﬁles in a password-protected archive.\n5. Use an uploader or other malware to send the archived ﬁles to an attacker-controlled server.\nThe uploader software is proprietary to this group, but Datper and xxmm also contain an\nuploading feature. When exﬁltration is complete, the uploader (or Datper or xxmm) immediately\nuses the del command to delete the RAR archives.\nFigure 16 shows BRONZE BUTLER extracting a new list of ﬁles and archiving a speciﬁc ﬁle into RAR format\nfor exﬁltration.\nFigure 16. Extracting a new ﬁle list and archiving a targeted ﬁle for exﬁltration. (Source: Secureworks)\n The group uses a password to encrypt ﬁles for RAR archiving. CTU researchers have observed the following\npasswords used in BRONZE BUTLER network compromises:\n1234qwer\n1234qwer!\n1234$%qwer\n1qazxsw2\n1qazxcde32ws\nConclusion\nBRONZE BUTLER compromises organizations to conduct cyberespionage, primarily focusing on Japanese\nenterprises. Initial attack vectors include spearphishing emails, SWCs, and exploiting vulnerability in software\ncommonly used by Japanese businesses. The group can override security controls to exﬁltrate intellectual\nproperty, and victims should formulate a solid eviction plan before engaging with the threat actors to\nprevent them from reentering the network.\nCTU researchers recommend that organizations, particularly those whose assets and intellectual property\ncould be valuable to BRONZE BUTLER, implement the following security practices:\nReview proxy log settings to ensure they capture information such as HTTP parameters and User-\nAgents for future analysis. Search proxy log ﬁles for evidence of web server scanning using the URL\npatterns associated with BRONZE BUTLER activity.\nUse an advanced endpoint threat detection ( ) solution to monitor activity on network endpoints.\nInstall a background monitor tool (e.g., ) to log detailed Windows event information to assist\nwith incident response.AETD\nSysmon\nImplement timely vulnerability patching and system updates. Update SKYSEA Client View implementations\nto the latest version as soon as possible.\nReview network access control. In particular, review network access for use of mobile USB modems on\ncorporate systems. Also implement strict security controls for privileged accounts such as Active\nDirectory administrator to prevent access by an unauthorized user.\nThreat indicators\nThe indicators in Table 3 are associated with BRONZE BUTLER activity. The URLs may contain malicious\ncontent, so consider the risks before opening them in a browser.\nIndicator Type Context\n795327de450e7f1e371a019a3d43673b60df4b7bf91138afa9ddc3913384f913
