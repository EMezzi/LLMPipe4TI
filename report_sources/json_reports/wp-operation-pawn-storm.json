Opposing factions to and dissidents of \nthe Russian government, international media, \nand even the national security department \nof a U.S. ally were also targeted. The threat \nactors used three attack vectors―spear-\nphishing emails with malicious attachments, \nan advanced network of phishing websites, \nand exploits injected into legitimate Polish \nwebsites. Among the targets of the advanced \nphishing attacks were ACADEMI, a defense \ncontractor formerly known as “Blackwater,” \nSAIC, and the Organization for Security \nand Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). \nAs discussed in this research paper, the \nattackers used a simple but clever JavaScript \ntrick to target Microsoft™ Outlook® Web Access (OWA) users from the previously \nmentioned organizations. The OWA phishing \nattacks seemed effective and so could be \nparticularly dangerous to any organization \nthat allows employees to use OWA.\nAn in-depth look at six multistage attacks \nrevealed one thing in common―the use of \nSEDNIT/Sofacy malware [1], [2] . The use \nof such multistage downloaders provided \nattackers additional protection against \ndetection. We believe the threat actors aimed \nto confuse their targets’ IT administrators \nby making it hard for them to string attack \ncomponents together, thus evading detection.\nThis research paper details when certain \nattacks occurred, what tools were used in \nattempts to get in to target networks, and \ntarget profiles to form a general picture of \nOperation Pawn Storm.Trend Micro | Operation Pawn Storm2TIES THAT BIND THE OPERATION PAWN\nSTORM ATTACKS TOGETHER\nSEDNIT\nSEDNIT malware are mostly backdoors [3], [4]  \nand information stealers [5] that log affected \nusers’ keystrokes, steal system information, \nand send stolen information to remote \ncommand-and-control (C&C) servers.\nAnalyses of the SEDNIT infectors that arrived \nas email attachments in the attacks featured \nin this paper revealed six distinct chains [see \ndiagram on page 3] .Attack Timeline\nThe investigation focused on a group of \nattacks that has been dubbed “Operation \nPawn Storm” [6] due to the attackers’ use of \ntwo or more connected tools/tactics to attack \na specific target similar to the chess strategy \nit was named after. This paper illustrates how \nthe Pawn Storm attacks were carried out with \nthe aid of five spear-phishing emails, which \nused contextually relevant subjects to get \nspecific targets from different countries to \nopen weaponized attachments designed to \ncompromise their systems.\n \nTimeline of spear-phishing emails sent to specific targets\nThe attackers sent emails to potential victims, \nincluding military, embassy, and defense \ncontractor personnel. The following emails \nwere among those that were found related to \nthis operation:\n• An email sent to a potential victim \nfrom the Ministry of Defense in France \nhad an exploit for CVE-2010-3333 \n[7] disguised as a document named “International Military.rtf.” Trend Micro \nreceived a sample of this on October \n17, 2011 and has been detecting it as \nTROJ_ARTIEF.AP [8] since then.\n• An email sent to a potential victim \nworking from the Vatican Embassy \nin Iraq used reports of a bombing \nincident [9] that occurred on January \n9, 2012 as social engineering lure. 3\nTrend Micro | Operation Pawn Storm\n \nSEDNIT infectors attached to targeted attack campaign emails\nSent a day after the incident, \nthe email had a Microsoft \nWord® file attachment named \n“IDF_Spokesperson_Terror_\nAttack_011012.doc,” which \nexploited CVE-2012-0158 [10].\n \nSample email sent to recipients from the \nVatican Embassy in Iraq\n \nExploit for CVE-2012-0158 disguised as a \nWord (.DOC) fileTrend Micro | Operation Pawn Storm4• An email sent on September 20, \n2013 to military officials from several \ncountries used the then-upcoming \n“Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation \n(APEC) Indonesia 2013” conference \nas bait. The email had two Microsoft \nExcel® file attachments named \n“APEC Media list 2013 Part1.xls,” \nwhich exploited CVE-2012-0158, and \n“APEC Media list 2013 Part2.xls,” \nwhich was nonmalicious.\n \nSample email sent to military officials across \ncountries using the “APEC Indonesia 2013” \nconference as bait\n \nExploit for CVE-2012-0158 disguised as an Excel \n(.XLS) file (APEC Media list 2013 Part1.xls)\n• An email sent to Pakistani military \nofficials on January 23, 2014 used the \n“Homeland Security Summit Middle \nEast” [11] conference as bait. It had a \nWord file attachment named “Details.doc,” which exploited CVE-2012-\n0158.\n \nSample email sent to military officials from \nPakistan using the “Homeland Security Summit \nMiddle East” conference as bait\n• An email sent to Polish government \nemployees [12] on August 11, 2014 \nhad a MIME HTML (.MHT) file \nattachment named “MH17.doc,” which \nexploited CVE-2012-0158.\n \nExploit for CVE-2012-0158 disguised as a MIME \nHTML (.MHT) file\nAttack Details\nAll of the observed Operation Pawn Storm \nattacks comprised several stages. Each \nattack had at least two phases:\n• In phase 1, opening the email \nattachment displays a decoy \ndocument while the exploit runs in \nthe background. The exploit drops \na downloader component (.DLL file) \nnamed “netids.dll,” “netidt.dll,” or \n“coreshell.dll.”Trend Micro | Operation Pawn Storm5• In phase 2, the downloader \ncomponent communicates with a C&C \nserver and downloads a dropper that \nultimately installs a keylogger. After capturing information from infected \nsystems, the keylogger sends data \nback to the C&C server.\n \nPhases 1 and 2 in an Operation Pawn Storm attack\nWe only managed to collect latter-\nstage payloads for two out of the six \naforementioned attacks. The C&C servers \ntied to the other four attacks refused to serve \nthe rest of the files to complete the attack \nchains.\nMultistage attacks are a double-edged sword. \nIf one link in the attack chain, aside from \nthe end node, is detected and removed in \nthe initial infection stage, the entire attack \nfails. On the other hand, having several \nlinks in the attack chain makes detecting the \nfinal component more difficult. Tracing the \nprevious and next links is also difficult when \nany of the components is inspected on its \nown outside the attack chain.Although some of the C&C servers were still \nalive at the time of investigation, they did not \nrespond to our infected systems. Repeated \nattempts to trick the C&C servers into serving \nthe next files in the incomplete attack chains \nfailed. The attacks they were tied to could be \ntime sensitive and it is possible that they no \nlonger hosted the files for succeeding stages.\nAttack Evolution\nEven though the filenames used for different \ncomponents remained fairly consistent from \n2010 to the present, earlier attacks were \nmore elaborate and complex compared with \nthose seen this year. The 2014 attacks we \nhave seen were more streamlined.Trend Micro | Operation Pawn Storm6\n \nComparison of an Operation Pawn Storm attack in 2011 and another in 2014\nAlthough variations in past and current \nattack chains exist, both are still being \nused by threat actors to date to ensure one thing—detection evasion. The following table \ncompares and contrasts the six Operation \nPawn Storm attacks in greater detail.7\nTrend Micro | Operation Pawn StormOperation Pawn Storm Attack Comparison\nCase 1 Case 2 Case 3 [13] Case 4 Case 5 Case 6\nUnknown exploit, \npossibly disguised \nas a .PDF, .DOC, \nor .RTF file, carries \nthe top-level dropper \n(dropper.exe;

In September \n2014, for instance, the Power Exchange \nwebsite in Poland, www . irgit . pl, was \ncompromised. The attackers rigged it with an \niframe that pointed to http :// defenceiq .   \nus / 2rKYZ _ BGxPM and http :// api . akmicdn .   \ncom / gpw ? key = 1072726955. The first link \nled to an exploit kit [14] that was responsible \nfor spreading SEDNIT malware. The \nESET paper did not mention that an earlier \nincident occurred in mid-July 2014 wherein \na malicious iframe pointing to yovtube . co \nwas injected into Polish government \nwebsites though. And that the same domain, \ndefenceiq . us, was used against Japanese \ntargets in September 2014.\nIt is remarkable that a mass infection \nmethodology was used by the Pawn Storm \nactors even though the actual SEDNIT \nsamples were only served to particular \ntargets. Actual exploitation was only triggered \nwhen certain criteria that had to do with OS, \nlanguage settings, time zone, and installed \nsoftware were met.\nNext-Level Phishing Targets\nThe attackers used specially crafted emails \nto redirect targets to any of several phishing \nwebsites with domain names that were very \nsimilar to those of well-known conferences \nand media outfits. These websites did not \nhost malicious content but visiting them \ndid lead to the automatic execution of a \nnonmalicious JavaScript. Links to these fake \nwebsites were then embedded in spear-\nphishing emails and sent to selected targets.\nOpening such an email and clicking the \nlink in OWA redirected victims to legitimate \nwebsites. The JavaScript made it appear that \nthe victims’ OWA sessions ended while at the same time, tricked them into reentering \ntheir credentials. To do this, the attackers \nredirected victims to fake OWA log-in pages \nby setting their browsers’ open windows \nproperty. The victims’ credentials thus ended \nup in the attackers’ hands.\nNote that two special conditions need to \nbe met for the attacks to succeed—victims \nshould use OWA and click the embedded \nlinks via the web portal’s preview pane. The \nattacks worked on any popular browser such \nas Firefox®, Safari®, Chrome™, and Internet \nExplorer®. No vulnerabilities need to be \nexploited for the JavaScript to work.\nBecause many companies allow employees \nto use webmail services to access their \nmailboxes while on business travel or at \nhome, these attacks are likely to succeed. \nOnce they do, attackers can gain access to \ncompromised mailboxes that they can then \nuse to gain a foothold in target networks.\nThroughout the course of investigation, \nseveral targets have been identified, \nincluding:\n• ACADEMI, formerly Blackwater \n(United States)\n• Broadcasting companies in various \ncountries\n• Military attachés from various \ncountries\n• Ministry of Defense (France)\n• Ministry of Defense (Hungary)\n• Multinational company based in \nGermany\n• OSCE (Austria)\n• Pakistani military officials\n• Polish government employeesTrend Micro | Operation Pawn Storm12• SAIC (United States)\n• U.S. Department of State\n• Vatican Embassy (Iraq)\nThe following case studies reveal more in-\ndepth details on four specific attacks.\nCASE 1: MINISTRY OF DEFENSE, \nHUNGARY\n• Malicious conference domain: \neurosatory2014 . com\n• Real conference domain: \neurosatory . com\n• Phished OWA domain: mail . hm .   \nqov . hu\n• Real OWA domain: mail.hm.gov.hu\nThe attackers created a domain that was \nvery similar to eurosatory . com [15], a website \nfor an international land and air-land defense \nand security exhibition. They then sent emails \nwith the link, http :// eurosatory2014 . com, to \nselected employees of the target defense \nministry who might actually have been \nexpecting to hear from the conference staff \nmembers.\nClicking the link embedded in the email \nvia the OWA preview pane opens the real \nconference website in a new tab. The victims’ \nOWA session in the other tab, meanwhile, \nis redirected to a phished log-in page that \nmakes it look like the session has ended.\n \nReal “EUROSATORY 2014” conference website \nopens in a new tab after clicking the link in a \nspear-phishing email viewed in OWA\n \n“Closed” OWA session page (fake) victims will \nsee, forcing them to reenter their credentials\nIn reality, the victims’ OWA session did not \nend. The previously mentioned JavaScript \njust redirected them to a fake OWA log-\nin page that looks just like the Ministry of \nDefense in Hungary’s real one.\nApart from “EUROSATORY 2014,” other \nconferences were also used to target \nemployees of the Ministry of Defense in \nHungary as shown in the following table.Trend Micro | Operation Pawn Storm13Similar Attacks Against the Ministry of Defense, Hungary\nConference Target Domain Malicious Domain\n“Africa Aerospace and Defence \n2014”aadexpo . co . za aadexpo2014 . co . za\n“The 10th Special Operations \nForces Exhibition & Conference”sofexjordan . com sofexjordan2014 . com\n“ITEC” itec . co . uk itec2014 . co . uk\nCASE 2: OSCE, AUSTRIA\n• Malicious news domain: vice - news .   \ncom\n• Real news domain: news . vice . com\n• Phished OWA domain: log-in - osce .   \norg\n• Real OWA domain: log-in . osce . org\nThis attack targeted OSCE employees in \nAustria.

The threat \nactors registered a domain that looked \nvery similar to the target’s real domain and \npurchased a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) \ncertificate for the fake domain as part of \npreparations for a targeted attack. Trend \nMicro was able to warn the target early on, \nwhich helped thwart the threat.Trend Micro | Operation Pawn Storm15Other Webmail Services\nOWA users are not the only ones at risk \nthough, as the threat actors behind Operation \nPawn Storm also targeted users of free webmail services such as Gmail™, Live Mail, \nYahoo!®, Hushmail, and Yandex.\n \nSample Gmail, Live Mail, Hushmail, and Yandex account phishing websites\nWe leaked specific credentials to the threat \nactors in a couple of cases to see if the \nfake webmail service log-in pages were \nindeed intended for attack use. Within \nminutes of leaking the test credentials, \nunauthorized log-ins were recorded. The \nfirst log-in was usually an automated log-\nin check from the same IP address as the \nphishing website’s owner. The succeeding \nlog-ins were made from the IP addresses, 46.166.162.90 (Latvia) and 192.154.110.244 \n(United States), via Internet Message Access \nProtocol (IMAP). No other forms of abuse \nsuch as sending spam via the compromised \naccounts were witnessed. This showed that \nthe attackers were indeed trying to obtain \nsensitive data from their targets instead \nof using their accounts for fraud and other \nfinancially motivated scams.Trend Micro | Operation Pawn Storm16CONCLUSION\nOperation Pawn Storm used next-level \nspear-phishing tactics to obtain the email \ncredentials of primarily military, embassy, \nand defense contractor personnel from the \nUnited States and its allies. The threat actors \nused a mix of spear-phishing emails and \nspecially crafted webmail service phishing \nwebsites to gain access to victims’ inboxes in \nhopes of getting better footholds inside target \norganizations. So as not to raise suspicion, \nthe attackers used well-known events and \nconferences as social engineering bait. They \nhave been quite persistent as well, as we \nhave seen evidence that attacks have been \ngoing on since 2007.\nApart from effective phishing tactics, the \nthreat actors used a combination of proven \ntargeted attack staples to compromise \nsystems and get in to target networks—\nexploits and data-stealing malware. SEDNIT \nvariants particularly proved useful, as \nthese allowed the threat actors to steal all \nmanners of sensitive information from the \nvictims’ computers while effectively evading \ndetection.\nTrend Micro has notified the targets that have \nbeen identified in this paper. Individuals and \ntheir respective organizations, meanwhile, \nshould use solutions that can help protect \nagainst the various attack vectors that the \nthreat actors behind Operation Pawn Storm \nused.Messaging security solutions such as Trend \nMicro™ InterScan™ Messaging Security \n[16] and the ScanMail™ Suite for Microsoft \nExchange [17] can send suspicious email \nattachments to a sandbox for analysis, thus \nprotecting recipients from threats. Other \nproducts such as OfficeScan™ [18] for \nendpoints and InterScan Web Security Virtual \nAppliance [19] for gateways can also block \nuser access to known phishing websites.\nFor overall protection against targeted \nattacks, Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery \n[20] can help protect potential targets by \nsandboxing and analyzing suspicious \nattachments to identify phishing emails via \nEmail Inspector. Via 360-degree monitoring \nof network traffic to get networkwide \nvisibility and intelligence, Deep Discovery \nallows users to detect and respond to \ntargeted attacks and advanced threats. \nIt also monitors all ports and more than \n80 protocols, giving users the broadest \nprotection available. Even more, specialized \ndetection engines and custom sandboxing \nhelp identify and analyze malware, C&C \ncommunications, and evasive attacker \nactivities that are invisible to standard \nsecurity solutions. Along with in-depth threat \nintelligence, it allows for rapid response \nand automatic sharing with other security \nproducts to create real-time custom defense \nagainst attacks.Trend Micro | Operation Pawn Storm17REFERENCES\n[1] Trend Micro Incorporated.
