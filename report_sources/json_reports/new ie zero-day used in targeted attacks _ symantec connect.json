The number of exploits taking advantage\nof unknown and unpatched vulnerabilities has been breathtaking.\nOne such case started few days ago when we received information about a possible exploitation using older\nversions of Internet Explorer as targets. Hackers had sent emails to a select group of individuals within targeted\norganizations. Within the email, the perpetrators added a link to a specific page hosted on an otherwise legitimate\nwebsite. The hackers had gotten access to the website account and uploaded content without the owners\nknowing. Here is what the email looked like:\nThe link pointed to a page which contained a script looking to see what version of the browser and operating\nsystem the visitor was using. Since the specific exploit page only worked when someone was using Internet\nExplorer 6 and 7, the script only transferred the visitor to the page hosting the exploit when this condition was met.\nIn other cases, the users didn't see anything but a blank website.\nVisitors who were served the exploit page didn't realize it, but went on to download and run a piece of malware on\ntheir computer without any interaction at all. The vulnerability allowed for any remote program to be executed\nwithout the end user's notice. Once infected, the malware set itself to start up with the computer, along with a\nservice named 'NetWare Workstation'. The piece of malware opens a backdoor on the computer and then contacts\nremote servers. It tries to contact a specific server hosted in Poland for small files named with a '.gif' extension.\nThese small files are actually encrypted files with commands telling the Trojan what to do next. It was programmed\nin a manner to be able to download these small, encrypted files from the following folders on the remote server:\nimages\npic\nimage\nbinary\nnews\nindex\npicture\nbbs\nWe were able to get a network capture of the traffic with a bunch of such '.gif' (named) files that contained\ncommands. Here is a very short snippet of what the attacker did on an compromised computer:\nLooking at the flow of commands, it is obvious to us that someone is entering these commands manually from a\nremote computer.\nThe files being downloaded by the attacker were hosted on yet another hacked website. The owners of this server\nwere also unaware of their computer being involved in hosting of malicious programs.\nIn fact, when we contacted the owners of the server which housed the original exploit page and malware, they\nimmediately took down the malicious content. Looking at the log files from this exploited server we know that the\nmalware author had targeted more than a few organizations. The files on this server had been accessed by people\nin lots of organizations in multiple industries across the globe. Very few of them were seen accessing the payload\nfile, which means that most users were using a browser which wasn't vulnerable or targeted.\nWe informed Microsoft of the vulnerability just as we were able to confirm it, and they were able to confirm our\nfindings about the vulnerability itself. They also confirmed that the vulnerability seems to be limited to IE 6, 7, and\n8. Microsoft plans to post an advisory on this subject in the coming hours. Once public, it will be available here .\nSymantec has detection in place for this IE vulnerability as Downloader . Initial Symantec detection names for the\nmalware served after exploitation were Downloader and Trojan Horse . They have since changed to Backdoor.Pirpi .\nI know we normally end such blogs with a little blurb about safe computing. Since you're still reading this article\nhere is one such note to the people who have control of servers facing the Internet—these computers are your\nresponsibility. Make sure you know what is being served off of these computers, patch them, install firewalls with\nappropriate configuration, change passwords regularly, and—most of all—don't allow it to accept connections from\nthe Web unless you know what you're doing.\nNote:  Since the posting of this blog, this vulnerability has been assigned the following information:\nCVE-2010-3962\nBID 44536\nBlog Entry Filed Under:\nSecurity , Security Response , Endpoint Protection (AntiVirus) , Backdoor.Pirpi , Downloader , Trojan Horse\nShare\nLinksLinks\nTechnical SupportTechnical Support\nSymantec TrainingSymantec Training\nSymantec.comSymantec.com\nPurchase Endpoint Protection SmallPurchase Endpoint Protection Small\nBusiness EditionBusiness Edition\nPurchase SSL CertificatesPurchase SSL Certificates\nWebsite Security Solutions KnowledgeWebsite Security Solutions Knowledge\nBaseBase\nUpcoming EventsUpcoming Events\nSF/Bay Area Data Loss Prevention User\nGroup Meeting - September 9\n09 Sep, 2014 - 11:00 PDT\nCyber Networking Event\n10 Sep, 2014 - 15:00 BST\nThe 21st Century Legal Department –\nNew Challenges & Responsibilities in the\nEra of Big Data\n10 Sep, 2014 - 10:00 PDT\nAbout Security ResponseAbout Security Response\nBlogBlog\nOur security research centers\naround the world provide\nunparalleled analysis of and\nprotection from malware, security\nrisks, vulnerabilities, and spam.\nRecent Blog PostsRecent Blog Posts\nCountering the security risks from third party\nmobile apps  • Hon Lau  • 22 Aug 2014\n19:36:33 GMT\nEuropean automobile businesses fall prey to\nCarbon Grabber  • Lionel Payet  • 22 Aug 2014\n10:25:37 GMT\nPhishers serve up Paolo Bediones sex video,\nsteal Facebook user logins  • Avdhoot Patil  • 22\nAug 2014 00:02:44 GMT\nEbola fear used as bait, leads to malware\ninfection  • Symantec Security Response  • 18\nAug 2014 19:13:52 GMT\nRobin Williams goodbye video used as lure in\nsocial media scams  • Satnam Narang  • 14\nAug 2014 21:32:10 GMT\nFilter by:Filter by:\nAuthor\nEnglish\nBlog TagsBlog Tags\nSecurity Response BlogSecurity Response Blog\nArchiveArchive\nAugust 2014  (11)\nJuly 2014  (13)\nJune 2014  (19)\nMay 2014  (18)\nApril 2014  (20)\nMarch 2014  (15)\nFebruary 2014  (22)\nJanuary 2014  (17)\nDecember 2013  (16)\nNovember 2013  (24)\nOctober 2013  (20)\nSeptember 2013  (14)\nAugust 2013  (16)\nJuly 2013  (34)\nJune 2013  (32)\nMay 2013  (27)\nApril 2013  (23)\nMarch 2013  (23)\nFebruary 2013  (26)\nJanuary 2013  (22)\nDecember 2012  (17)\nNovember 2012  (20)\nOctober 2012  (13)\nSeptember 2012  (15)\nAugust 2012  (29)\nJuly 2012  (26)\nJune 2012  (22)\nMay 2012  (26)\nApril 2012  (16)\nMarch 2012  (23)\nFebruary 2012  (18)\nJanuary 2012  (17)\nDecember 2011  (12)\nNovember 2011  (11)\nOctober 2011  (20)\nSeptember 2011  (13)\nAugust 2011  (20)\nJuly 2011  (19)\nJune 2011  (28)\nMay 2011  (26)\nApril 2011  (18)\nMarch 2011  (31)\nFebruary 2011  (23)\nJanuary 2011  (19)\nDecember 2010  (11)\nNovember 2010  (17)\nOctober 2010  (24)\nSeptember 2010  (30)\nAugust 2010  (26)\nJuly 2010  (32)\nJune 2010  (26)\nMay 2010  (26)\nApril 2010  (32)\nMarch 2010  (31)\nFebruary 2010  (30)\nJanuary 2010  (26)\nDecember 2009  (21)\nNovember 2009  (32)\nOctober 2009  (38)\nSeptember 2009  (21)\nAugust 2009  (31)\nJuly 2009  (36)\nJune 2009  (24)\nMay 2009  (23)\nApril 2009  (35)\nMarch 2009  (43)\nFebruary 2009  (25)\nJanuary 2009  (29)\nDecember 2008  (17)\nNovember 2008  (21)\nOctober 2008  (22)\nSeptember 2008  (17)\nAugust 2008  (22)\nJuly 2008  (8)\nJune 2008  (8)\nMay 2008  (9)\nApril 2008  (18)\nMarch 2008  (20)\nFebruary 2008  (30)\nJanuary 2008  (29)\nDecember 2007  (34)\nNovember 2007  (50)\nOctober 2007  (38)\nSeptember 2007  (30)\nAugust 2007  (43)\nJuly 2007  (34)\nJune 2007  (36)\nMay 2007  (36)\nApril 2007  (42)\nMarch 2007  (53)\nFebruary 2007  (45)\nJanuary 2007  (43)\nDecember 2006  (43)\nNovember 2006  (40)\nOctober 2006  (30)\nSeptember 2006  (27)\nAugust 2006  (31)\nJuly 2006  (32)\nJune 2006  (14)\nMay 2006  (20)\nRecently on TwitterRecently on Twitter\nCountering the security risks from third party\nmobile apps http://t.co/hlmZyXL2cy\nhttp://t.co/jSlmxo8dMp\n22 Aug 2014\n#Encyption keys could be stolen by touching\nthe exposed metal parts of laptops, claim\nresearchers http://t.co/XabjCLyczW\n(@drpizza)\n22 Aug 2014\nAttackers could take advantage of mobile\napps to make premium-rate calls from the\nvictim's phone http://t.co/DHUT7l0cc8\n(@Jeremy_Kirk)\n22 Aug 2014\nEuropean automobile businesses fall prey\nto Carbon Grabber crimeware\nhttp://t.co/SWZxB9OPJT #Europe\n#Crimeware\n22 Aug 2014\nMore cyberattacks target the US healthcare\nsector.
