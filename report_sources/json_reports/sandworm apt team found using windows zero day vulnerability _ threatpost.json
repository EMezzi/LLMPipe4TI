The vulnerability, which will be patched today\nby Microsoft, is trivially exploitable and researchers say that the team behind the attacks has\nbeen using it since August to deliver the Black Energy malware.\nResearchers at iSIGHT Partners  said that the team, which they’ve dubbed Sandworm, likely\nhas been active since 2009 and has been using the Windows vulnerability CVE-2014-4114 in\nconjunction with a series of other flaws in order to compromise users at government\nagencies, NATO, academic institutions, a telecom, defense and energy firms. The attackers\nuse highly targeted spearphishing emails in order to lure users into opening a rigged\nPowerPoint file that contains the exploit code for the vulnerability. Once the exploit code\nfires, it then downloads the Black Energy malware and begins gathering sensitive data for\nexfiltration.\nResearchers at iSIGHT said that the malware steals sensitive documents, SSL keys and code-\nsigning certificates, among other things. The Windows zero day affects all currently\nsupported versions of Windows and researchers said that exploiting the bug is extremely\nsimple. The exploit code can be loaded into any Office document and when it executes, the\nmachine doesn’t crash, so the user is likely unaware of the attack.\n“It is extremely easy to recreate. This requires a low level of technical expertise to\nrecreate,” said Drew Robinson, senior technical analyst at iSIGHT.\nThe iSIGHT researchers reported the Windows vulnerability to Microsoft on Sept. 5, and also\nbegan notifying its partners and customers in various sectors about the ongoing Sandworm\ncampaign.\nThe spearphishing emails sent to victims are highly customized to appeal to the recipients’\ninterests, such as a white paper targeted at attendees of the GlobeSec conference. Other\ndocuments are specifically targeted at users in countries such as Poland and Ukraine,\nRobinson said. The iSIGHT researchers said the company has seen about 12 organizations\ntargeted with the Windows zero day thus far, beginning in August. In each case, the attack\nresults in the installation of Black Energy, a venerable Trojan that’s been used in a variety of\nattacks for several years.\n“Everything we’re seeing is Black Energy,” Robinson said. “It’s probably in part because it’s a\nmodular framework and they can do whatever they want on victims’ computers.”\nBlack Energy has gone through several iterations and iSIGHT said that the Sandworm\nattackers are using Black Energy 2 , an intermediate version that includes DDoS capabilities\nand the ability to steal financial credentials.\nResearchers at Kaspersky Lab have been looking at the Black Energy 2 malware attacks for a\nlong time, and Alex Gostev, chief security expert of the GReAT Team at Kaspersky, said\nidentifying these attackers as Russian could be premature.\n“The number of cyber espionage operations is growing from one month to the next. Some\nof these operations stand out for various reasons: sophisticated malware, skills of the\ncybercriminals, or the resources that enable them to continue their espionage activities for\na long period or buy expensive zero-days. Any of the above may indicate that an espionage\noperation is connected with the work of government-controlled structures but proving this\nconnection is extremely difficult – it is the work of investigation agencies, rather than IT\nsecurity companies,” Gostev said.\n“Cybercriminals may leave traces indicating that they speak a certain language or belong to\na certain ethnic group in order to mislead investigators. Moreover, people in many post-\nSoviet countries communicate in Russian, particularly in the information technology sector.\nTherefore, making conclusions about a ‘Russian’ trace based on this evidence is ill-advised.\nThe files/documents that the cybercriminals are after do not provide sufficient evidence\nfrom which to draw firm conclusions either.”\nThe team using the CVE-2014-4114 zero day has been active for a number of years, and\niSIGHT researchers said that the attacks identified most recently have similarities to older\noperations and has been observed using traditional crimeware tactics in the past. The attack\ninfrastructure the Sandworm team used in these recent attacks also overlaps in some cases\nwith proxies used in other operations. Robinson said that the Sandworm team most likely is\nbased in Russia, a conclusion based on the group’s target selection, the use of Black Energy\nand technical details in the attacks.\nDespite some similarities, iSIGHT researchers said that the Sandworm team doesn’t appear\nto be related to the Energetic Bear attackers  who have been tied to other APT campaigns\nrecently.\nThis article was updated on Oct. 14 to add the comments from Gostev.\nImage from Flickr photos of Mark Skeet . \nShare this article:\nCritical Infrastructure\n Government\n Hacks\n Malware\n Vulnerabilities\nAPT36 Taps Coronavirus as\n‘Golden Opportunity’ to\nSpread Crimson RAT\nThe Pakistani-linked APT has been\nspotted infecting victims with data\nexfiltration malware.\nMarch 17, 2020\nActivities of a Nigerian\nCybercriminal Uncovered\nRise and fall of a Nigerian cybercriminal\ncalled ‘Dton,’ who made hundreds of\nthousands of dollars in a 7-year\ncampaign, outlined in new report.\nMarch 17, 2020\nMicrosoft Edge Shares\nPrivacy-Busting Telemetry,\nResearch Alleges\nAn academic study found Microsoft’s\nEdge browser to be the least private,\ndue to it sending device identifiers and\nweb browsing pages to back-end\nservers.\nMarch 16, 2020\nA Practical Guide to Zero-Trust\nSecurity\nJanuary 15, 2020  2\n7 Tips for Maximizing Your SOC\nDecember 31, 2019  5\nMean Time to Hardening: The Next-\nGen Security Metric\nDecember 30, 2019  4\nCombining AI and Playbooks to\nPredict Cyberattacks\nDecember 26, 2019  1\nThe Case for Cyber-Risk Prospectuses\nDecember 24, 2019  1\nNewsletter\nSubscribe to Threatpost Today  \nJoin thousands of people who receive the\nlatest breaking cybersecurity news every day.\nSubscribe now\nTwitter\nRT : Study: Microsoft\nEdge sends frequent hashed IDs tied to\nhardware to its back-end servers,\nmaking it one of the least private…\n12 mins ago\nFollow @threatpost\n@Techmeme\nThe First Stop For Security News Home\n About Us\n Contact Us\n Advertise With Us\n RSS Feeds\nCopyright © 2020 Threatpost Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Advertise\n Black Hat Breaking News Cloud Security Critical Infrastructure Cryptography Facebook\nGovernment Hacks IoT Malware Mobile Security Podcasts Privacy RSAC\nSecurity Analyst Summit Videos Vulnerabilities Web Security\nSUGGESTED ARTICLES\nDISCUSSIONINFOSEC INSIDER\nTOPICS\nSubscribe to our newsletter, Threatpost Today !
