The\nperpetrators then sent emails that lured a select group of people in targeted\norganizations to the booby-trapped page, causing those who used IE\nversions 6 and 7 to be infected with a backdoor trojan.\nThe exploit required no interaction on the part of victims and gave no\nindication what was happening. While the exploit page was found on a\nsingle website, Symantec researchers warned the attacks may have been\nwidespread.\n“Looking at the log files from this exploited server we know that the malware\nauthor had targeted more than a few organizations,” they wrote . “The files\non this server had been accessed by people in lots of organizations in\nmultiple industries across the globe.”\nIn an encouraging sign, few of the visitors were affected because they\nweren't using a vulnerable browser, they added.\nVersion 8 of IE may also be vulnerable, but a security protection known as\nDEP, or data execution prevention – which is turned on by default – causes\nthe browser to crash rather than to remotely execute the malicious code,\nMicrosoft said. DEP, which was first added to IE 7, is designed to lessen\nthe damage of such attacks by preventing data loaded into memory from\nbeing executed. While hackers have figured out ways to bypass the\ntechnology , so-called heap-spraying attacks don't work well with this\nparticular bug.\nThe security flaw resides in a part of IE that handles CSS, or Cascading\nStyle Sheets, tags. As a result, the browser under-allocates memory,\nallowing data to be overwritten in memory vtable pointers. By spraying\nmemory with special data, an attacker can cause IE to execute code.\nThe report is the latest reminder of the benefits of moving to the latest\nversion of IE – or to a different browser altogether. Those who must use IE\nversions 6 or 7, should consider augmenting it with EMET, Microsoft's tool\nfor locking down older applications . It can be used to add DEP and other\nsecurity mitigations to a variety of programs, including IE and Adobe\nReader.\nMicrosoft didn't say when it planned to patch the vulnerability, but Jerry\nBryant, a spokesman for Microsoft response, indicated the bug probably\ndidn't warrant a release outside of the company's normal update cycle. That\nmeans the earliest we're likely to see a fix is December 14.\nMicrosoft has more details here, here and here. ®\nSponsored: Practical tips for Office 365 tenant-to-tenant migration\nMORE  Internet Explorer  Zero Day  Attack\n   {* *}\nBy Dan Goodin  3 Nov 2010 at 18:06\nTips and corrections 11 Comments\nSign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily-MOST READ\n1  \n2  \n3  \n4  \n5  \nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR WEEKLY\nTECH NEWSLETTER//\nNASA to launch 247\npetabytes of data into AWS\n– but forgot about eye-\nwatering cloudy egress\ncosts before lift-off\nBritish Army adopts\nWhatsApp for formal orders\nas coronavirus isolation\nkicks in\nClosed source?
