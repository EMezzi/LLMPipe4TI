The report contains an extensive set of indicators\nwith detailed context and information around them. Part of the Russian sphere of influence, the\nthreat group discussed in the U-CRT report is the perpetrator of documented cer espionage\nattacks  around the world, man of which target industrial and manufacturing firms and critical\ninfrastructure. Known  man names, the group is most prominentl known as ‘ nergetic ear ’ and\n‘Crouching Yeti.’\nDetailed analsis of nergetic ear’s malware and activities was recentl done  Kaspersk , and\nRiskIQ initiall investigated them earlier this ear. Through our we crawling network, we were ale\nto determine that a wesite elonging to a Turkish energ compan was eing used in a watering\nhole attack targeting people associated with Turkish critical infrastructure. Compromised via a\nsuppl chain attack, the site was injected with M credential-harvesting malware. RiskIQ then\nlinked the malicious infrastructure to a string of related Turkish sites that were compromised for the\nsame purpose and traced the attack ack to a likel timeframe in which it egan.\nWatering hole attacks, especiall those involving suppl chain compromises, have een an\nextremel effective method  for operators of cer espionage campaigns ecause the target\nvictims of specific groups, organizations, and regions, and with close ut tumultuous relations\netween Turke and the Russian Federation, Turke is not a surprising target for nergetic ear. We\nshared our findings with law enforcement and national CRT partners, ut now that the indicators\nhave ecome pulic per U-CRT’s pulication, we want to give our unique point of view on the\nthreat.\ntrategical Compromise for Reconnaissance\nPart of nergetic ear’s campaign involved strategical we compromises that give them exposure to\nspecific targets. For example, prior activities from the group include compromising software\nsuppliers for programmale logic controller (PLC) components used in critical infrastructure and\nackdooring them with the Havex malware . In the case of the campaign descried in the U-CRT\nreport, the group compromised the wesite of Turcas Petrol, a Turkish energ compan, located at\nturcas.com.tr.\nFig-1 turcas.com.tr\nIn Ma 2017, during one of our crawls of Turcas’ wesite, RiskIQ encountered a watering hole setup\nin use  nergetic ear. In the screenshot of the wesite aove, ou can see four top elements:\n‘Join the Turcas nerg Famil,’ ‘Announcements,’ ‘Compan News,’ and ‘Tv interviews.’ These\nseparate elements are structured as iframes to other pages on the wesite as shown in the DOM\ncapture elow:\nFig-2 DOM capture showing the modified susection\nHowever, the iframe’d page for the ‘Announcements’ susection was modified  nergetic ear\noperators to contain a small addition in the form of an image inclusion:\nFig-3 Malicious image inclusion\nThe image URL redirects to a link using the file://  scheme, which forces the connection through the\nfile protocol, which then allows the group to harvest Microsoft M credentials. This ehavior was\nalso noted  Talos, which wrote a detailed analsis of the spear-phishing emails  elonging to the\nsame campaign as this watering hole attack. It’s interesting to note that the ack-end server used in\nthe attack seems to e written using the Tornadoerver Pthon framework  used for uilding we\nand networking applications:\nFig-4 Response headers showing the ack-end server\nIn the case of Turcas Petrol, elow is the entire chain of events we oserved during the crawl:\nFig-5 The entire chain of events oserved  RiskIQ\nIn and of itself, this compromise seems targeted at Turcas Petrol and those with a close relationship\nwith the usiness, a tactic that mirrors other nergetic ear campaigns. ssentiall, the group’s goal\nis to influence areas of interest to the Russian Federation. What we’d like to show, which seems to\ne missing from the U-CRT report, is the entire chain of events for this attack. \nRiskIQ found that the M credential harvesting host at 184.154.150.66  is not alwas directl\nincluded on the wesites. Instead, the intermediar host at 103.41.177.58  is usuall present on the\nwe pages, which, in turn, redirect visitors—most likel with some filtering to avoid unwanted traffic\n—to the M harvesting host. Additionall, the URL format of the file requested, which in this case\nwas turcas_icon.png , is not related to the referring wesite. Instead, nergetic ear seems to use a\nform of tagging to correlate an possile victims and their source wesite. The format we oserved\nis <tag>_icon.png  and <tag>.png .\ntrategical Compromise for road Targeting\nThe previous example of the Turcas Petrol wesite compromise showed specific targeting. While\ncompan-specific wesites were compromised in this campaign, ‘general purpose’ wesites were\nalso amongst the victims. One such site is plantengineering.com  which serves as an information and\nnews hu for the critical infrastructure sector.\nFig-6 Another compromised wesite linked to the attack\nFor a few months in earl 2017, this wesite had one of its resources compromised, likel meaning\nthat nergetic ear operators had road access to the server. On the main page of the wesite, a\nresource loads from /tpo3conf/ext/t3s_jslidernews/res/js/jquer.easing.js  as seen in our crawl:\nFig-7 Compromised resource\nThe compromised resource is a modified version of jQuer asing  Javacript lirar. At the ottom\nof the script, we can find the M credential harvesting link, which is emedded as an image\nelement in the main page’s DOM:\nFig-8 M credential harvesting link\nWhen we go through more of our data for this ver simplified direct image inclusion, we find a\npattern in the URLs and wesites. Here are three of our hits:\nhttp://www.plantengineering.com/tpo3conf/ext/t3s_jslidernews/res/js/jquer.easing.js\nhttp://www.csemag.com/tpo3conf/ext/t3s_jslidernews/res/js/jquer.easing.js\nhttp://www.controleng.com/tpo3conf/ext/t3s_jslidernews/res/js/jquer.easing.js\nAll three URLs are the same, as is the injected content. All the affected wesites are news and\ninformation wesites for the industrial sector, which indicates a definite pattern. o, who owns\nthese wesites? Looking at the WHOI information in PassiveTotal we find plantengineering.com  is\nowned  CF Media LLC :\nFig-9 WHOI record for affected sites\nReading a it further, we find the email address srourke@cfemedia.com  was used to register the\ndomain. Pivoting off this address we can see the same pattern that we saw with the URLs:\nFig-10 Other affected sites\nFrom our data, RiskIQ found that controleng.com , plantengineering.com , and csemag.com  were all\naffected  the injection from nergetic ear. ecause the’re geared toward engineers working in\nthe critical infrastructure sector and thus prime targets for this watering hole attack, the odds are\nthat CF Media’s other wesites were affected. In fact, CF Media has at least six confirmed rands\nthat pulish news and information:\nFig-11 rands affected  the nergetic ear campaign\necause we started seeing nergetic ear’s M-harvesting injection at the end of March and our\ncrawl data from the end of Januar was still clean, RiskIQ has een ale to pinpoint the start of the\ncampaign to etween the eginning of Feruar and the end March.\nConclusion: Don’t Feed the ear\nOver the past few ears,  suppl-chain attacks are ecoming more and more prevalent in the\nattacker’s portfolio. Javacript can e changed and compromised without the knowledge of the site\nowner, finding its wa onto a site when pulic code was modified downstream. To prevent this, site\nowners must have an understanding of what elongs to their organization, how it’s connected to\nthe rest of their asset inventor, including inventoring all the third-part code running on their we\nassets so the can avoid eing a pawn  operators like nergetic ear.\nigning up for RiskIQ Communit dition  now gives ou access to one of the most popular RiskIQ\nproducts–Digital Footprint.
