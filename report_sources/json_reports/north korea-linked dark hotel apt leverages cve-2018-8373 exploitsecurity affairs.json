The attacker could also\nembed an ActiveX control marked ‘safe for initialization’ in an application or Microsoft Office\ndocument that hosts the IE rendering engine.\n“A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in\nInternet Explorer. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary\ncode in the context of the current user.” reads the security advisory  published by Microsoft.\n“An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the\ncurrent user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability\ncould take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or\ncreate new accounts with full user rights.”\nThe analysis of the exploit code for the CVE-2018-8373 revealed it shared the obfuscation technique\nimplemented for another exploit triggering the CVE-2018-8174  flaw.\nThe CVE-2018-8174  was first discovered by experts at Chinese security company Qihoo 360 and it\nwas fixed in May by Microsoft.\nThe similarities in the exploits suggest that were developed by the same threat actor.\n“We found this exploit using heuristics, which led to a more in-depth analysis. Interestingly, we found that this\nexploit sample uses the same obfuscation technique as exploits for CVE-2018-8174 , a VBScript engine remote\ncode execution vulnerability patched  back in May” wrote Trend Micro.\n“We suspect that this exploit sample came from the same creator. Our analysis revealed that it used a new use-\nafter-free (UAF) vulnerability in vbscript.dll, which remained unpatched in the latest VBScript engine.”\nA similar theory was proposed by experts from Qihoo that collected evidence that linked the use of\nthe CVE-2018-8373 exploit to Dark Hotel.\nThe experts discovered that domain name embedded in Office documents in latest attacks is the same\nused to download Double Kill exploit code in previous attacks linked to the North Korea-linked APT\ngroup.\n“The 360 Threat Intelligence Center first obtained the IOC address after Trend Micro coding through the big data\nanalysis association:\nhttp://windows-updater[.]net/realmuto/wood[.]php?who=1??????\nAssociated homologous 0day attack sample” states Qihoo\n“And found an attack time and trend technology found in the wild “double kill” 0day attack on the same day\nsuspected of using the 0day attack of the office document sample, the domain name embedded in the Offce\ndocument sample and the domain name format given by Trend Micro (http ://windows-\nupdater[.]net/stack/ov[.]php?w= 1\\x00who =1)”\nIn the analysis published in May by Qihoo 360 the researchers associated the CVE-2018-8373 exploit\nwith Dark Hotel based on TTPs associated with the threat actor (e.g. the decryption algorithm that\nmalware used is identical to Dark Hotel’s one).\nExperts speculated that the CVE-2018-8373 was used in a cyber espionage campaign aimed at China.\nPierluigi Paganini\n(Securi ty Affairs  – Dark Hotel, APT)\nAPT CVE-2018-8174 Dark Hotel APT Hacking North Korea Pierluigi Paganini\nSecurity Affairs\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKEShare this...\n\n\nPREVIOUS ARTICLE\nChina's Belt and Road project (BRI) is a\ndriver of regional cyber threat activity\n NEXT ARTICLE\nSecurity Affairs newsletter Round 176 –\nNews of the week \n\nThis site uses cookies, including for analytics, personalization, and advertising purposes.
