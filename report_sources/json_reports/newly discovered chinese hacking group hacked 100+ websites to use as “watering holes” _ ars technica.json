The majority of the targets of the hacking\ngroup were in the automotive, electronic, aerospace, energy, and pharmaceutical industries. The\ngroup, believed to be based in China, has also targeted defense contractors, colleges and\nuniversities, law firms, and political organizations—including organizations related to Chinese\nminority ethnic groups.\nDesignated as Threat Group 3390 and nicknamed \"Emissary Panda\" by researchers, the hacking\ngroup has compromised victims' networks largely through \"watering hole\" attacks launched from\nover 100 compromised legitimate websites, sites picked because they were known to be\nfrequented by those targeted in the attack.\nAt least 50 organizations in those industries in the US and the United Kingdom had data stolen by\nmembers of Emissary Panda. Sites targeted included the website of the Embassy of the Russian\nFederation in the US (as well as those of other embassies and non-governmental organizations);\ngovernment agency websites around the world; manufacturing companies, many of whom were\nsuppliers to defense contractors; and the Spanish defense manufacturer Amper. A cultural site for\nthe Chinese Uyghur ethnic group was also used, apparently to target members of the Muslim\nminority for surveillance.\nNo zero-day vulnerabilities were used to breach targeted networks, instead \"the group relied on\nold vulnerabilities such as CVE-2011-3544 \"—a near-year-old Java security hole—\"and CVE-2010-\n0738 to compromise their targets,\" Dell SecureWorks' researchers reported. The group used a\nnumber of tools common to other Chinese hacking groups, but they had a few unique tools of\ntheir own with interfaces developed for Standard (Simplified) Chinese. One of these is the PlugX\nremote access tool, \"a notorious piece of malware linked to a number of attacks and to another\nThreat Group, which researchers believe is also likely based out of China,\" according to Dell\nSecureWorks researchers. It also appears the group used China's Baidu search engine to perform\nreconnaissance on targets.\nVisitors to sites exploited by Emissary Panda are directed by code embedded in the sites to a\nmalicious webpage, which screens their IP address. If the address falls within ranges that the\nattackers are interested in, the malicious site waits for their next page view to drop an exploit on\nthe desirable target's PC. (There has also been at least one victim targeted by a spear-phishing\nattack.) A variety of malware, including the PlugX tool, was shared with other known Chinese\nthreat groups. But two tools used were unique to the group: ASPXTool, an Internet Information\nServices (IIS) specific \"Web shell\" used to gain access to servers inside a target's network; and the\nOwaAuth credential stealing tool and Web shell, used to attack Microsoft Exchange servers running\nthe Web Outlook interface.\nOnce inside networks, the group generally targeted Windows network domain controllers and\nExchange e-mail servers, targeting user credentials to allow them to move to other systems\nthroughout the targeted network. They used an exploit of Internet Information Server to inject\nkeylogger and backdoor malware onto the Exchange server. Getting into domain controller and\nExchange servers gave the attackers an opportunity to steal administrator and other high-level\ncredentials, and they could then quickly identify other points of interest and move to compromise\nother systems on the network—often within just two hours of the initial compromise.\nEmissary Panda wants to eat all the industrial data—and has hacked hundreds of sites to target people with access to it.Chen Wu\n23\nHow Crash Bandicoot Hacked The Original\nPlaystation\nFor today’s episode of War Stories, Ars Technica sat down with Naughty Dog Co-\nfounder Andy Gavin to talk about the hurdles in bringing the original Crash\nBandicoot to gamers around the world.
