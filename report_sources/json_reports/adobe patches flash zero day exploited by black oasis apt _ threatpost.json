Sold by the controversial German company Gamma International,\nFinSpy, or FinFisher, is a suite of surveillance and espionage software used to remotely\nmonitor compromised computers. It’s sold to governments and law enforcement around\nthe world, including allegations of sales to oppressive regimes including Egypt, Bahrain,\nEthiopia, Uganda and elsewhere.\nThe vulnerability, CVE-2017-11292, was privately disclosed Oct. 10 by researchers at\nKaspersky Lab, who saw the payload and exploit used against a customer’s network. The\nattackers spread the exploit via email, embedding the Flash exploit inside an Active X object\ninside a Word document. Brian Bartholomew, a member of Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research\nand Analysis Team (GReAT), said retrieval of the payload—which is the latest FinSpy version\n—is done in multiple stages.\nAdobe said Flash version 27.0.0.159 on the desktop, Linux and Google Chrome is affected,\nas well as version 27.0.0.130 for Edge and Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 10 and 8.1. Users\nshould be sure to be running Flash 27.0.0.170 on all platforms, or heed the advice of many\nsecurity experts to disable Flash all together. Flash has been designated for end-of-life .\nKaspersky Lab published a report  today about the zero day on Securelist.com.\nBlack Oasis is a bit of an enigma among APT groups. The group has been on Kaspersky Lab’s\nradar for nearly a year, Bartholomew said, and has had at least five zero-day vulnerabilities\nand exploits at its disposal since 2015, all of which have been disclosed and patched. There is\nonly one known victim of the Flash zero day patched today, he said.\n“These guys are definitely customers of Gamma. They’ve been using FinSpy for maybe the\nlast two years,” Bartholomew said. “They were also potentially customers of Hacking Team.”\nBlack Oasis appears to have made use of a Hacking Team zero day, CVE-2015-5119 , prior to\nthe Italian software company being hacked in the summer of 2015 and having many of its\nattacks publicly dumped online.\n“We know this group was also using that exploit, which we assume was unique to Hacking\nTeam customers,” Bartholomew said. “They had access to it prior to the hack. Once the\nhack happened, I have not seen them using Hacking Team at all but they have been using\nFinSpy pretty regularly since.”\nThe APT group’s targets are government and military organizations in the Middle East,\ncountries in North Africa, as well as some in Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe.\n“FinSpy seems to be their payload of choice,” Bartholomew said.\nThis is the second zero-day vulnerability in possession of Black Oasis to be patched in the\nlast month. In September, FireEye disclosed  CVE-2017-8759, which was patched by\nMicrosoft and used to spy on an unnamed Russian individual. The vulnerability was described\nas a SOAP WSDL parser code injection bug spread via Microsoft Office RTF documents. The\ncode injection was used to download and execute script that included PowerShell\ncommands.\n“In the last two months, they’ve burnt two zero days. It’s very evident they have access to a\nwide swathe of zero days,” Bartholomew said.\nZero days can sell for six or seven figures on gray or black markets. They are a source of\nconstant debate between security and privacy experts and governments who buy these\nattacks for exclusive use as lawful intercept tools in the name of national security or law\nenforcement purposes.\nWhile Black Oasis may be very well resourced, its operational security may be lacking. For\nexample, the group re-used command and control servers burned by the FireEye disclosure\nin this recent round of attacks using the Flash zero day.\n“They had right around a month to move their infrastructure, but yet they didn’t,”\nBartholomew said.\nThe emergency update comes less than a week after Patch Tuesday when for the first time\nin recent memory, Adobe did not publish any security updates for any of its products.\nShare this article:\nVulnerabilities\nCoronavirus-Themed APT\nAttack Spreads Malware\nThe APT group was spotted sending\nspear-phishing emails that purport to\ndetail information about coronavirus –\nbut they actually infect victims with a\ncustom RAT.\nMarch 13, 2020\nFlaws Riddle Zyxel’s Network\nManagement Software\nOver 16 security flaws, including\nmultiple backdoors and hardcoded SSH\nserver keys, plague the software.\nMarch 11, 2020\nPopular ThemeREX WordPress\nPlugin Opens Websites to RCE\nThe bug has been under active attack as\na zero-day.\nMarch 10, 2020\nA Practical Guide to Zero-Trust\nSecurity\nJanuary 15, 2020  2\n7 Tips for Maximizing Your SOC\nDecember 31, 2019  5\nMean Time to Hardening: The Next-\nGen Security Metric\nDecember 30, 2019  4\nCombining AI and Playbooks to\nPredict Cyberattacks\nDecember 26, 2019  1\nThe Case for Cyber-Risk Prospectuses\nDecember 24, 2019  1\nNewsletter\nSubscribe to Threatpost Today  \nJoin thousands of people who receive the\nlatest breaking cybersecurity news every day.\nSubscribe now\nTwitter\nA Nigerian cybercriminal hoodwinked\nhundreds of thousands of victims with\na  campaign that asked\nthem to… \n2 hours ago\nFollow @threatpost\n#cybercrime\nhttps://t.co/r48fU6i00W\nThe First Stop For Security News Home\n About Us\n Contact Us\n Advertise With Us\n RSS FeedsCopyright © 2020 Threatpost Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Advertise\nBlack Hat Breaking News Cloud Security Critical Infrastructure Cryptography Facebook\nSUGGESTED ARTICLES\nDISCUSSIONINFOSEC INSIDER\nSubscribe to our newsletter, Threatpost Today !
