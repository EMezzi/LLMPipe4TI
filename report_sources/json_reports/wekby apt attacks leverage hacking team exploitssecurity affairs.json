However,\nnot to be out done , APT attackers have also started\nleveraging the exploit in targeted spear phishing\nattacks as well.” reports the blog post published by\nthe company.\nExperts speculate that the Wekby group is the APT that hacked the Community Health Systems  and\ncompromised 4.5 million patient records from the target by exploiting the Heartbleed  vulnerability.\nThe Wekby APT sent spear phishing  messages to the victims titled “Important: Flash update” trying to\nexploit the news of the release of the patch for Flash Player zero-day.\nThe campaign was lauched to compromise victims systems and serve the Gh0st RAT. Experts noticed\nthat the C&C used by the Wekby group is located in Singapore and was already used in the past by the\nsame threat actor.\nThe Wekby were sent out the malicious messages by using a spoofed Adobe email address and they\nincluded a link apparently pointing to the official Adobe download domain that was referring a\ndomain set up to serve the SWF file crafted to exploit the CVE-2015-5119 .\nThe Labels found by the experts in the SWF file suggest that the code for the Adobe exploits is the\nsame leaked in the Hacking Team hack.\n \nBad story …  and it is just the beginning!\nPierluigi Paganini\n(Security Affairs  – Wekby , APT)\nAdobe Adobe Flash APT CVE-2015-5119 Hacking Hacking Team Wekby zero-DayShare this...\n\n\n Copyright 2015 Security Affairs by Pierluigi Paganini All Right Reserved.
