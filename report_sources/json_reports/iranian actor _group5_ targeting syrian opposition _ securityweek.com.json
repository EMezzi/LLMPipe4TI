They called the actor Group5 , because it\ntargets Syrian opposition  after regime‐linked malware groups, the Syrian Electronic Army ,\nISIS (also known as the Islamic State or ISIL), and a group linked to Lebanon did the same in\nthe past.\nTo conduct its attacks, the group uses social engineering, as it “borrows opposition text and\nslogans for e‐mail messages and watering holes,” Citizen Lab researchers say. The group’s\ntechnical quality, however, is low, and researchers suggest that they identified the actor early\nin its lifecycle, before it could launch a full campaign using the malware it staged and\nprepared.\nThe group is believed to be state‐sponsored, at least in some form, though it’s yet unclear\nwhich state is behind it. However, Citizen Lab researchers reveal that Group5 is likely a new\nentrant in Syria, and that there is “only circumstantial evidence pointing to an Iranian nexus.”\nYet, the group’s activity shows that Syrian opposition is facing continuing information security\nrisks.\nThe investigation was triggered by a suspicious email received in early October 2015 by\nNoura Al‐Ameer, a well‐connected Syrian opposition political figure, which was sent from the\nsame IP address that hosted the command and control (C&C) server the malware inside it was\nconnecting to.\nThe email was sent from an address on assadcrimes[.] info , a website found to be distributing\nother malicious files, including a . ppsx and a .exe. The PPSX documents, for example, were\nfound to be leveraging the CVE‐2014‐4114  vulnerability to drop and execute malicious code,\nbut also to execute OLE objects using animation actions within a PowerPoint slideshow.\nResearchers also discovered that the group was employing two commonly available Remote\nAccess Trojans (RATs): njRat  and NanoCore  RAT for its nefarious operations. The binaries\nwere delivered hidden under several layers of obfuscation to reduce the possibility of\ndetection by antivirus software.\nThe two malware variants were used to collect data from the compromised machines, to\nkeep an eye on the victim’s screen, or capture passwords and keystrokes. They were also\nused to remotely delete files and even to spy on the computer user via the microphone or\nwebcam.\nIn addition to these malicious applications for Windows, the assadcrimes[.]info  website also\ncontained a decoy Flash Player update page that linked to a piece of Android malware called\nDroidJack . The Trojan, which evolved from a piece of malware called SandroRAT, was\nrecently used in a global attack, hidden inside a fake Pokémon GO application .\nThe Trojan was created to capture messages, contacts, photos and other data from the\ninfected Android device, as well as to remotely activate the phone camera and microphone,\nwithout notifying the victim. The use of this malware isn’t surprising, researchers say: “It is\ncommon for Syrians to share Android APK files outside the Google Play Store, as Google Play\nServices are not available within Syria.”\nBecause the assadcrimes[.]info  operators left a folder containing the website logs public,\nresearchers were able to identify the IP addresses used by Group5 while developing the site,\nthough they couldn’t conclusively identify victims’ IPs. During the site’s early development in\nthe first half of October, it was accessed hourly from an Iranian IP block. The operators also\naccessed the site from the malware’s C&C server, Citizen Lab says.\n“These links provide evidence for an Iranian nexus, and suggest that the operator may have\nbeen taking steps to conceal their true origin IP. However, these steps were not well\nexecuted, which enabled us to track Group5 as they continued to access the site,”\nresearchers reveal. According to them, however, the threat actor appears to have abandoned\nthe site after New Year, following a flurry of activity in October 2015.\nAccording to researchers, there is also the possibility that a known group was behind all this\noperation and that a key piece that was missing from the puzzle prevented the investigators\nfrom making the correct associations, although the tools used to obfuscate the RATs link the\ngroup to known threat actors (Mr. Tekide) and tools (the PAC Crypt tool).\n“We cannot conclude with certainty that Group5 is Iran‐based, although the confluence of\ninformation outlined above provides a circumstantial case. The IP addresses observed during\nearly stages of development of the Assadcrimes website, as well as the Iranian hosting\nprovider and the Persian language mailer, all speak to a level of Iranian presence. The\nadditional apparent involvement of an Iranian malware developer with ties to a known Iranian\ncyber actor, whether his involvement was unwitting or intentional, only strengthens the\nIranian connection,” researchers say.\nRelated: India‐Linked Threat Actor Targets Military, Political Entities Worldwide\nRelated: Hacktivists Leak 43GB of Data From Syrian Government\n \n Search\nBusiness Email AddressSUBSCRIBE TO THE DAILY BRIEFING\n   \n   \n    \nMost Recent Most Read\nHackers Target UK Fintech Company Finastra\nNew Mirai Variant Delivered to Zyxel NAS Devices\nVia Recently Patched Flaw\nUK Printing Company Exposed Military Documents\nRussian Cyberspies Hacked High‐Profile Email\nAccounts for Phishing\nRussia‐Linked Cybercriminals Use Legitimate Tools\nin Attacks on German Firms\nOracle VirtualBox, Adobe Reader, Windows\nHacked at Pwn2Own 2020\nAndroid Surveillance Campaign Leverages COVID‐19\nCrisis\nDrupal Updates CKEditor to Patch XSS\nVulnerabilities\nNIST Updates Flagship SP 800‐53 Security and\nPrivacy Controls\nGoogle Patches High‐Risk Chrome Flaws, Halts\nUpcoming Releases\nPopular Topics\nInformation Security News\nIT Security News\nRisk Management\nCybercrime\nCloud Security\nApplication Security\nSmart Device Security\nSecurity Community\nIT Security Newsletters\nICS Cyber Security Conference\nCISO Forum, Presented by Intel\nInfosecIsland.Com\nStay Intouch\nTwitter\nFacebook\nLinkedIn Group\nCyber Weapon Discussion\nGroup\nRSS Feed\nSubmit Tip\nSecurity Intelligence Group\nAbout SecurityWeek\nTeam\nAdvertising\nEvents\nWriting Opportunities\nFeedback\nContact Us\nCopyright © 2020 Wired Business Media.
