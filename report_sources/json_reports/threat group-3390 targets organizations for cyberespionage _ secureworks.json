Analysis of TG-3390's operations, targeting, and tools led CTU researchers to\nassess with moderate conﬁdence the group is located in the People's Republic of China. The threat actors\ntarget a wide range of organizations: CTU researchers have observed TG-3390 actors obtaining conﬁdential\ndata on defense manufacturing projects, but also targeting other industry verticals and attacking\norganizations involved in international relations. The group extensively uses long-running strategic web\ncompromises  (SWCs), and relies on whitelists to deliver payloads to select victims. In comparison to other\nthreat groups, TG-3390 is notable for its tendency to compromise Microsoft Exchange servers using a\ncustom backdoor and credential logger.[1]\n[2]\nCTU researchers divided the  about TG-3390 into two sections: strategic and tactical.\n includes an assessment of the ongoing threat posed by the threat group.\nExecutives can use this assessment to determine how to reduce risk to their organization's mission and\ncritical assets.  is based on incident response investigations and research, and is\nmapped to the kill chain.

Appendix A\nCTU researchers assess with moderate conﬁdence that TG-3390 is based in the People's Republic of\nChina.\nCTU researchers have evidence that the threat group compromised U.S. and UK organizations in the\nfollowing verticals: manufacturing (speciﬁcally aerospace (including defense contractors), automotive,\ntechnology, energy, and pharmaceuticals), education, and legal, as well as organizations focused on\ninternational relations. Based on analysis of the group's SWCs, TG-3390 operations likely affect\norganizations in other countries and verticals.\nTG-3390 operates a broad and long-running campaign of SWCs and has compromised approximately\n100 websites as of this publication. Through an IP address whitelisting process, the threat group\nselectively targets visitors to these websites.\nAfter the initial compromise, TG-3390 delivers the HttpBrowser backdoor to its victims. The threat\nactors then move quickly to compromise Microsoft Exchange servers and to gain complete control of\nthe target environment.\nThe threat actors are adept at identifying key data stores and selectively exﬁltrating all of the high-\nvalue information associated with their goal.\nCTU researchers recommend the following practices to prevent or detect TG-3390 intrusions:\nSearch web log ﬁles for evidence of web server scanning using the URIs listed in the\n section and evidence of exﬁltration using the User-Agent in the \nsection.Exploitation Actions on objective\nRequire two-factor authentication for all remote access solutions, including OWA.\nAudit ISAPI ﬁlters and search for web shells on Microsoft Exchange servers.\nStrategic threat intelligence\nCTU researchers assess the threat posed by a threat group by reviewing intent and capability (see Figure 1).\nThreat groups pose varying threats to different organizations, and even a very capable group may pose a\nlow threat if it does not have the intent to target a particular organization.\nFigure 1. Threat is based on a threat group's intent and capability. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\nIntent\nCTU researchers infer intent by aggregating observations, analyzing a threat group's activity, and placing the\ninformation in a wider context.\nLike many threat groups, TG-3390 conducts strategic web compromises (SWCs), also known as watering\nhole attacks, on websites associated with the target organization's vertical or demographic to increase the\nlikelihood of ﬁnding victims with relevant information. CTU researchers assess with high conﬁdence that TG-\n3390 uses information gathered from prior reconnaissance activities to selectively compromise users who\nvisit websites under its control. Most websites compromised by TG-3390 actors are afﬁliated with ﬁve types\nof organizations around the world:\nlarge manufacturing companies, particularly those supplying defense organizations\nenergy companies\nembassies in Washington, DC representing countries in the Middle East, Europe, and Asia, likely to\ntarget U.S.-based users involved in international relations\nnon-governmental organizations (NGOs), particularly those focused on international relations and\ndefense\ngovernment organizations\nBased on this information, CTU researchers assess that TG-3390 aims to collect defense technology and\ncapability intelligence, other industrial intelligence, and political intelligence from governments and NGOs.\nAttribution\nTo assess attribution, CTU researchers analyze observed activity, third-party reporting, and contextual\nintelligence. For the following reasons, CTU researchers assess with moderate conﬁdence that TG-3390 has\na Chinese nexus:\nThe SWC of a Uyghur cultural website suggests intent to target the Uyghur ethnic group, a Muslim\nminority group primarily found in the Xinjiang region of China. Threat groups outside of China are\nunlikely to target the Uyghur people.\nTG-3390 uses the PlugX remote access tool. The menus for PlugX's server-side component are written\nexclusively in Standard Chinese (Mandarin), suggesting that PlugX operators are familiar with this\nlanguage.\nCTU researchers have observed TG-3390 activity between 04:00 and 09:00 UTC, which is 12:00 to\n17:00 local time in China (UTC +8). The timeframe maps to the second half of the workday in China.\nThe threat actors have used the Baidu search engine, which is only available in Chinese, to conduct\nreconnaissance activities.\nCTU researchers have observed the threat group obtaining information about speciﬁc U.S. defense\nprojects that would be desirable to those operating within a country with a manufacturing base, an\ninterest in U.S. military capability, or both.\nCTU researchers recognize that the evidence supporting this attribution is circumstantial. It is possible that\nTG-3390 is false-ﬂag operation by a threat group outside of China that is deliberately planting indications of\na Chinese origin.\nCapability\nTo assess a threat group's capability, CTU researchers analyze its resources, technical proﬁciency, and\ntradecraft.\nResources\nTG-3390 has access to proprietary tools, some of which are used exclusively by TG-3390 and others that\nare shared among a few Chinese threat groups. The complexity and continual development of these tools\nindicates a mature development process. TG-3390 can quickly leverage compromised network infrastructure\nduring an operation and can conduct simultaneous intrusions into multiple environments. This ability is\nfurther demonstrated by analysis of interactions between TG-3390 operators and a target environment. CTU\nresearchers found no evidence of multiple operators working simultaneously against a single organization.\nThis efﬁciency of operation (a 1:1 ratio of operator to observed activity) suggests that TG-3390 can scale to\nconduct the maximum number of simultaneous operations. These characteristics suggest that the threat\ngroup is well resourced and has access to a tools development team and a team focused on SWCs.\nTechnical proﬁciency\nTG-3390's obfuscation techniques in SWCs complicate detection of malicious web trafﬁc redirects. Malware\nused by the threat group can be conﬁgured to bypass network-based detection; however, the threat actors\nrarely modify host-based conﬁguration settings when deploying payloads. CTU researchers have observed\nthe threat actors installing a credential logger and backdoor on Microsoft Exchange servers, which requires\na technical grasp of  (IIS). TG-3390 uses older exploits to compromise targets,\nand CTU researchers have not observed the threat actors using zero-day exploits as of this publication. The\nthreat actors demonstrated the ability to adapt when reentering a network after an eviction, overcoming\ntechnical barriers constructed by network defenders.Internet Information Services\nTradecraft\nIn addition to using SWCs to target speciﬁc types of organizations, TG-3390 uses spearphishing emails to\ntarget speciﬁc victims. CTU researchers assess with high conﬁdence that the threat actors follow an\nestablished playbook during an intrusion. They quickly move away from their initial access vector to hide\ntheir entry point and then target Exchange servers as a new access vector. As of this publication, CTU\nresearchers have not discovered how TG-3390 keeps track of the details associated with its compromised\nassets and credentials. However, the threat actors' ability to reuse these assets and credentials, sometimes\nweeks or months after the initial compromise, indicates the group is disciplined and well organized. After\ngaining access to a target network in one intrusion analyzed by CTU researchers, TG-3390 actors identiﬁed\nand exﬁltrated data for speciﬁc projects run by the target organization, indicating that they successfully\nobtained the information they sought. Data exﬁltration occurred almost four weeks after the initial\ncompromise and continued for two weeks (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Data exﬁltration timeline. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\nNote: The adversary's end goal is to exﬁltrate, not inﬁltrate. Organizations often miss multiple opportunities to\ndetect and disrupt the threat actors before they can achieve their objective. Alerts for credential theft tools\nand privileged account lockouts should be investigated.\nTactical threat intelligence\nKnown tools\nCTU researchers have observed TG-3390 actors using tools that are favored by multiple threat groups:\nPlugX — A remote access tool notable for communications that may contain HTTP headers starting\nwith \"X-\" (e.g., \"X-Session: 0\"). Its presence on a compromised system allows a threat actor to execute\na wide variety of commands, including uploading and downloading ﬁles, and spawning a reverse shell.\nThe malware can be conﬁgured to use multiple network protocols to avoid network-based detection.\nDLL side loading is often used to maintain persistence on the compromised system.\nHttpBrowser (also known as TokenControl) — A backdoor notable for HTTPS communications with the\nHttpBrowser/1.0 User-Agent (see Figure 3). HttpBrowser's executable code may be obfuscated through\nstructured exception handling and return-oriented programming. Its presence on a compromised system\nallows a threat actor to spawn a reverse shell, upload or download ﬁles, and capture keystrokes.\nAntivirus detection for HttpBrowser is extremely low and is typically based upon heuristic signatures.\nDLL side loading has been used to maintain persistence on the compromised system. More information\nabout HttpBrowser is available in . Appendix B\n \nFigure 3. HttpBrowser URI. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\nChinaChopper web shell — A web-based executable script (see Figure 4) that allows a threat actor to\nexecute commands on the compromised system. The server-side component provides a simple\ngraphical user interface for threat actors interacting with web shells.\nFigure 4. ChinaChopper web shell. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\nPasswords, like \"admin-na-google123!@#\" shown in Figure 4, are required to interact with the web shell.\nTG-3390 has used additional web shells containing similarly formatted passwords.\nHunter — A web application scanning tool written by @tojen to identify vulnerabilities in Apache Tomcat,\nRed Hat JBoss Middleware, and Adobe ColdFusion (see Figure 5). It can also identify open ports,\ncollect web banners, and download secondary ﬁles.\nFigure 5. Hunter usage. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\nThe following tools appear to be exclusive to TG-3390:\nOwaAuth web shell — A web shell and credential stealer deployed to Microsoft Exchange servers. It is\ninstalled as an ISAPI ﬁlter. Captured credentials are DES-encrypted using the password \"12345678\" and\nare written to the log.txt ﬁle in the root directory. Like the ChinaChopper web shell, the OwaAuth web\nshell requires a password. However, the OwaAuth web shell password contains the victim organization's\nname. More information about the OwaAuth web shell is available in . Appendix C\nASPXTool — A modiﬁed version of the ASPXSpy web shell (see Figure 6). It is deployed to internally\naccessible servers running Internet Information Services (IIS).\nFigure 6. ASPXTool web shell. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\nTG-3390 actors have also used the following publicly available tools:\nWindows Credential Editor (WCE) — obtains passwords from memory\ngsecdump — obtains passwords from memory\nwinrar — compresses data for exﬁltration\nnbtscan — scans NetBIOS name servers\nTactics, techniques, and procedures\nIncident response engagements have given CTU researchers insight into the tactics TG-3390 employs\nduring intrusions.\nReconnaissance\nCTU researchers have not observed TG-3390 actors performing reconnaissance prior to compromising\norganizations. As discussed in the  section, the threat actors appear to wait until they\nhave established a foothold.Actions on objectives\nDevelopment\nTG-3390 actors use command and control (C2) domains for extended periods of time but frequently\nchange the domains' IP addresses. The new IP addresses are typically on the same subnet as the previous\nones.\nTG-3390 is capable of using a C2 infrastructure that spans multiple networks and registrars. The most\ncommon registrar used by the adversary is HiChina Zhicheng Technology Ltd. The threat actors have a\ndemonstrated ability to move from one network provider to another, using some infrastructure for extended\nperiods of time and other domains for only a few days. Seemingly random activity patterns in infrastructure\ndeployment and usage, along with the ability to use a wide variety of geographically diverse infrastructure,\nhelp the threat actors avoid detection.\nTG-3390 SWCs may be largely geographically independent, but the group's most frequently used C2\nregistrars and IP net blocks are located in the U.S. Using a U.S.-based C2 infrastructure (see Figure 7) to\ncompromise targets in the U.S. helps TG-3390 actors avoid geo-blocking and geo-ﬂagging measures used in\nnetwork defense.\nFigure 7. Geolocation of TG-3390 infrastructure observed by CTU researchers. The dark green signiﬁes a\nhigh count of C2 registrars and IP net blocks, while the light green represents a smaller count. (Source: Dell\nSecureWorks)\nThe threat actors create PlugX DLL stub loaders that will run only after a speciﬁc date. The compile dates\nof the samples analyzed by CTU researchers are all later than the hard-coded August 8, 2013 date,\nindicating that the code might be reused from previous tools.\nThe OwaAuth web shell is likely created with a builder, given that the PE compile time of the binary does\nnot change between instances and the conﬁguration ﬁelds are padded to a speciﬁc size. The adversaries\nmodify publicly available tools such as ASPXSpy to remove identifying characteristics that network defenders\nuse to identify web shells.\nWeaponization\nAs of this publication, CTU researchers are unsure if TG-3390 relies on weaponizers to package tools and\nexploits.\nDelivery\nTG-3390 conducts SWCs or sends spearphishing emails with ZIP archive attachments. The ZIP archives\nhave names relevant to the targets and contain both legitimate ﬁles and malware. One archive sample\nanalyzed by CTU researchers contained a legitimate PDF ﬁle, a benign image of interest to targets (see\nFigure 8), and an HttpBrowser installer disguised as an image ﬁle.\nFigure 8. Decoy image. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\nIn SWCs analyzed by CTU researchers, the threat actors added the Dean Edwards  JavaScript code\nshown in Figure 9 to the end of a legitimate website's menu page.packed\nFigure 9. SWC code. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\nAs shown in Figure 10, the  JavaScript code reveals an iframe pointing to an IP address that is\nhosting the exploit.unpacked\nFigure 10. Unpacked JavaScript code. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\nBoth the redirect code on the compromised site and the exploit code appear and disappear, indicating that\nthe adversaries add the code when they want to leverage the SWC and remove the code when it is not in\nuse to limit the visibility of their operations. The threat actors have evolved to whitelisting IP addresses and\nonly delivering the exploit and payload to speciﬁc targets of interest. CTU researchers have observed TG-\n3390 compromising a target organization's externally and internally accessible assets, such as an OWA\nserver, and adding redirect code to point internal users to an external website that hosts an exploit and\ndelivers malware.\nExploitation\nTG-3390 actors have used Java exploits in their SWCs. In particular, the threat actors have exploited \n, a vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment, to deliver the HttpBrowser backdoor; and \n, a vulnerability in JBoss, to compromise internally and externally accessible assets used to\nredirect users' web browsers to exploit code.CVE-\n2011-3544 CVE-\n2010-0738\nIn activity analyzed by CTU researchers, TG-3390 executed the Hunter web application scanning tool\nagainst a target server running IIS. Hunter queried the following URIs in a speciﬁc order to determine if the\nassociated software conﬁgurations are insecure, and all queries contained the HttpClient User-Agent:\nGET /manager/html/ — Tomcat web application manager\nGET /jmx-console/ — JBoss conﬁguration\nGET /CFIDE/administrator/login.cfm — ColdFusion conﬁguration\nInstallation\nTG-3390 uses DLL side loading, a technique that involves running a legitimate, typically digitally signed,\nprogram that loads a malicious DLL. CTU researchers have observed the threat actors employing legitimate\nKaspersky antivirus variants in analyzed samples. The DLL acts as a stub loader, which loads and executes\nthe shell code. The adversaries have used this technique to allow PlugX and HttpBrowser to persist on a\nsystem.\nNote: DLL side loading is a prevalent persistence technique that is used to launch a multitude of backdoors.\nThe challenge is detecting known good software loading and running malware. As security controls have\nimproved, DLL side loading has evolved to load a payload stored in a different directory or from a registry\nvalue.\nIn other cases, threat actors placed web shells on externally accessible servers, sometimes behind a reverse\nproxy, to execute commands on the compromised system. TG-3390 actors have deployed the OwaAuth\nweb shell to Exchange servers, disguising it as an ISAPI ﬁlter. The IIS w3wp.exe process loads the malicious\nDLL, which CTU researchers have observed in the Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange\nServer\\ClientAccess\\Owa\\Bin directory.\nCommand and control\nTo traverse the ﬁrewall, C2 trafﬁc for most TG-3390 tools occurs over ports 53, 80, and 443. The PlugX\nmalware can be conﬁgured to use HTTP, DNS, raw TCP, or UDP to avoid network-based detection. In one\nsample analyzed by CTU researchers, PlugX was conﬁgured with hard-coded user credentials to bypass a\nproxy that required authentication. Newer HttpBrowser versions use SSL with self-signed certiﬁcates to\nencrypt network communications.\nTG-3390 actors frequently change the C2 domain's A record to point to the loopback IP address 127.0.0.1,\nwhich is a variation of a technique known as \"parking.\" Other variations of parking point the IP address to\nGoogle's recursive name server 8.8.8.8, an address belonging to Conﬂuence, or to other non-routable\naddresses. When the adversaries' operations are live, they modify the record again to point the C2 domain\nto an IP address they can access. A domain name parking example is available in . Appendix D\nActions on objective\nCTU researchers have discovered numerous details about TG-3390 operations, including how the\nadversaries explore a network, move laterally, and exﬁltrate data. As shown in Figure 11, after compromising\nan initial victim's system (patient 0), the threat actors use the Baidu search engine to search for the victim's\norganization name. They then identify the Exchange server and attempt to install the OwaAuth web shell. If\nthe OwaAuth web shell is ineffective because the victim uses two-factor authentication for webmail, the\nadversaries identify other externally accessible servers and deploy ChinaChopper web shells. Within six\nhours of entering the environment, the threat actors compromised multiple systems and stole credentials for\nthe entire domain.\nFigure 11. Timeline, in Eastern Time, of TG-3390's initial entry into a victim's network. (Source: Dell\nSecureWorks)\nThe threat actors use the Hunter and nbtscan tools, sometimes renamed, to conduct network\nreconnaissance for vulnerable servers and online systems (see Figure 12). TG-3390 actors favor At.exe to\ncreate scheduled tasks for executing commands on remote systems.\nFigure 12. nbtscan batch script (renamed ipcan.exe) used to proﬁle network. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\nOver a few days' span, the threat actors install remote access tools on additional systems based upon the\nresults of the network reconnaissance. They use At.exe to schedule tasks to run self-extracting RAR\narchives, which install either HttpBrowser or PlugX. CTU researchers observed the threat actors collecting\nCisco VPN proﬁles to use when accessing the victim's network via VPN (see Figure 13).\nFigure 13. Copying of .pcf ﬁles. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\nTo facilitate lateral movement, the adversaries deploy ASPXTool web shells to internally accessible systems\nrunning IIS.\nCTU researchers have observed the threat actors encrypting data using the password \"admin-windows2014\"\nand splitting the RAR archives into parts in the recycler directory, with the same name as the\nuncompressed data (see Figure 14).\nFigure 14. Batch script used to archive data. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\nThe number at the end of the password corresponds to the year of the intrusion. For example, the\npassword \"admin-windows2014\" shown in Figure 14 was changed to \"admin-windows2015\" for TG-3390\nintrusions conducted in 2015.\nNote: CTU researchers frequently observe threat actors renaming archiving tools and storing data for\nexﬁltration in uncommon directories. In some instances, adversaries exceed disk space limits during the\nexﬁltration process, requiring the staging of archives on multiple systems. Unexplained disk quota alerts on\ntypically underutilized systems warrants immediate investigation.\nAnother batch script run by a scheduled task renames the archives on the ﬁle server (see Figure 15).\nFigure 15. Batch script used to rename exﬁltrated data. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\nCTU researchers have observed TG-3390 actors staging RAR archives, renamed with a .zip ﬁle extension, on\nexternally accessible web servers. The adversaries then issue HTTP GET requests, sometimes with the User-\nAgent MINIXL, to exﬁltrate the archive parts from the victim's network (see Figure 16).\nFigure 16. Example GET request from IIS log. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\nIn other intrusions, data was exﬁltrated using the PlugX remote access tool. Figure 17 shows network data\ntransfer sizes for a month-long period beginning with TG-3390's re-entry into a network. Approximately 300\nGB of data was exﬁltrated during that span.\nFigure 17. Network data transfer sizes to C2 servers after TG-3390 reentry into a network. (Source: Dell\nSecureWorks)\nCTU observations\nFigure 18 is a UTC time wheel depicting which hours the threat actors actively operated in one target\nenvironment during a three-day intrusion observed by CTU researchers. The concentric bands represent the\ndays of the week, with Saturday as the outside band and Sunday as the innermost band, and each cell\nrepresents an hour. The darker the cell color, the higher the activity level; white indicates no observed\nactivity. TG-3390 was most active between 04:00 and 09:00 UTC.\nFigure 18. Mapping of TG-3390's interactions with web shells during an intrusion responded to by CTU\nresearchers. The legend across the bottom of the ﬁgure lists the upper bound of interactions that are\nrepresented by each color variation on the wheel. Times are based on UTC. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\nResponse to eviction\nSuccessfully evicting TG-3390 from an environment requires a coordinated plan to remove all access points,\nincluding remote access tools and web shells. Within weeks of eviction, the threat actors attempt to access\ntheir ChinaChopper web shells from previously used IP addresses. Finding the web shells inaccessible, the\nadversaries search google.co.jp for remote access solutions. CTU researchers discovered the threat actors\nsearching for \"[company] login,\" which directed them to the landing page for remote access. TG-3390\nattempts to reenter the environment by identifying accounts that do not require two-factor authentication\nfor remote access solutions, and then brute forcing usernames and passwords. After reestablishing access,\nthe adversaries download tools such as gsecudmp and WCE that are staged temporarily on websites that\nTG-3390 previously compromised but never used. CTU researchers believe legitimate websites are used to\nhost tools because web proxies categorize the sites as benign.\nNote: Numerous threat groups use legitimate remote access solutions (VPN, Citrix, OWA, etc.) to enter or\nreenter a network. After executing an eviction plan, it is paramount to reset all credentials, including those\nfor third-party accounts, preferably after implementing two-factor authentication.\nTG-3390 actors keep track of and leverage existing ASPXTool web shells in their operations, preferring to\nissue commands via an internally accessible web shell rather than HttpBrowser or PlugX. After reentering an\nenvironment, the threat actors focus on obtaining the active directory contents. Figure 19 shows a timeline\nof TG-3390 attempting to regain a foothold in a network in a span of only ﬁve hours.\nFigure 19. Timeline, in Eastern Time, of TG-3390's reentry into a compromised network. (Source: Dell\nSecureWorks)\nNote: Relying primarily on network-based security controls will not deter most threat groups from achieving\ntheir objective. Adversaries can overcome blacklisted infrastructure in minutes, as TG-3390 actors did when\nthey staged tools on compromised web servers.\nTeam member or team identiﬁer\nAnalysis of the OwaAuth web shell revealed a PDB string with the \"SyberSpace\" username (see Figure 20).\nFigure 20. OwaAuth web shell PDB string. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\nFurther research revealed additional tools containing the same username (see Figure 21).\nFigure 21. PDB strings containing the 'SyberSpace' username. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\nCTU researchers have no evidence to determine if these tools are also used by TG-3390.\nConclusion\nTG-3390 is known for compromising organizations via SWCs and moving quickly to install backdoors on\nExchange servers. Despite the group's proﬁciency, there are still many opportunities to detect and disrupt its\noperation by studying its . The threat actors work to overcome existing security controls, or\nthose put in place during an engagement, to complete their mission of exﬁltrating intellectual property. Due\nto TG-3390's determination, organizations should formulate a solid eviction plan before engaging with the\nthreat actors to prevent them from reentering the network.modus operandi\nThreat indicators\nThe indicators in Table 1 are associated with TG-3390 activity.

TG-3390 indicators.\nAppendix A — Identifying attribution and gauging\nconﬁdence\nIdentifying attribution\nIn most cases, CTU researchers not have intelligence to directly attribute a threat group, so attribution relies\non circumstantial evidence and is an assessment rather than a fact. CTU researchers draw on three distinct\nintelligence bases for evidence of attribution:\nObserved activity is gathered from CTU researchers' observation and investigation of a threat group's\nactivity on a target network and across Dell SecureWorks data, and analysis of tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures (TTPs) the threat group employs.\nThird-party intelligence is gained from trusted relationships within the security industry and with other\nprivate and public sector organizations, as well as analysis of open source intelligence.\nContextual analysis compares threat group targets against intelligence requirements of nation states\nand other threat actors and compares tradecraft employed by a threat group to tradecraft of known\nthreat actors.\nGauging conﬁdence level\nCTU researchers have adopted the grading system  by the U.S. Ofﬁce of the Director of National\nIntelligence to indicate conﬁdence in their assessments:published\n generally indicates that judgments are based on high-quality information, and/or that\nthe nature of the issue makes it possible to render a solid judgment. A \"high conﬁdence\" judgment is\nnot a fact or a certainty, however, and such judgments still carry a risk of being wrong.High conﬁdence\n generally means that the information is credibly sourced and plausible but not\nof sufﬁcient quality or corroborated sufﬁciently to warrant a higher level of conﬁdence.Moderate conﬁdence\n generally means that the information's credibility and/or plausibility is questionable, or\nthat the information is too fragmented or poorly corroborated to make solid analytic inferences, or that\n[there are] signiﬁcant concerns or problems with the sources.Low conﬁdence\nAppendix B — HttpBrowser analysis\nHttpBrowser is a remote access tool whose name originates from the hard-coded \"HttpBrowser/1.0\" User-\nAgent. CTU researchers also identiﬁed a PDB string in the binaries,\nJ:\\TokenControlV3\\ServerDll\\Release\\ServerDll.pdb, which implies that the threat actors may refer to the tool\nas \"TokenControl.\" Table 2 lists the commands available to threat actors in one of the HttpBrowser variants.\nCommand Functionality\nInit Create a reverse shell\nWrite Write a ﬁle to the compromised system from the C2 server\nList List the ﬁles in a directory\nUpload Upload a ﬁle from the compromised system to the C2\nserver\nTable 2. HttpBrowser command set. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\nOther variants of the backdoor may include additional commands such as setcmd, settime, uninstall, and\ndown. Table 3 shows the unencrypted URL parameters, along with sample data and a description of the\ndata.\nURL\nparameterSample data Description\nc= Victim->Administrator Hostname and username\nl= 192.168.1.100 Compromised system's IP address\no= 5,1,1,32 Windows major and minor version, coupled with\narchitecture (32 v. 64)\nu= {B5B70BD7-87FC-499A-B4D1-\n98163306F0D8}A GUID\nr= 1 Boolean value if the malware is running as injected\ncode\nt= 8035187 Number of milliseconds the computer has been running\nTable 3. HttpBrowser parameters. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\nAppendix C — OwaAuth web shell analysis\nOwaAuth is a web shell that is installed as an ISAPI ﬁlter on Exchange servers and shares characteristics\nwith the ChinaChopper web shell. Like ChinaChopper, it parses HTTP requests for the Z1 and Z2 parameters\n(see Table 4). The legitimate owaauth.dll ﬁle resides in %ProgramFiles%\\Microsoft\\Exchange\nServer\\ClientAccess\\Owa\\Auth\\ while CTU researchers have observed the backdoor using the same ﬁlename\nin the %ProgramFiles%\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\ClientAccess\\Owa\\bin\\ directory. In addition to acting as\na web shell, the malware captures and DES-encrypts credentials before writing the username and password\nto disk. The OwaAuth web shell enables a threat actor to upload and download ﬁles, launch processes, and\nexecute SQL queries.\nEach web shell instance is conﬁgured to contain SP, Key, and Log variables. The SP variable is a string\ncontaining the victim's username. When the malicious ISAPI ﬁlter captures a username matching this\nvariable, it knows to handle the incoming HTTP request as a command to the web shell. The DES key to\nencrypt the credentials in the conﬁguration observed by CTU researchers is 12345678, and the log ﬁle is\nc:\\log.txt. The decrypted contents of the log ﬁle adhere to the format in Figure 22.\nFigure 22. Decrypted OwaAuth log ﬁle format. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\nTable 4 lists the OwaAuth web shell commands available to the adversary.\nCommand Functionality\nA List logical drives\nB List directory (Z1 = directory name to list)\nC Read data from ﬁle (Z1 = ﬁlename to read)\nD Write content to ﬁle (Z1 = ﬁlename to write, Z2 = content to write)\nE Delete ﬁle in directory (Z1 = ﬁle)\nF Generate custom web response \"->|value in Z1|<-\"\nG Write hex-encoded content to ﬁle (Z1 = ﬁlename to write, Z2 = hex encoded content to\nwrite)\nH Call _Notice(Z1, Z2)\nI Move/rename ﬁle or directory (Z1 = target, Z2 = new name)\nJ Create directory (Z1 = directory name)\nK Timestomp ﬁle or directory (Z1 = target, Z2 = time/date string to stomp to)\nL Download ﬁle from Internet (Z1 = URL, Z2 = ﬁlename to write to)\nM Launch process (Z1 = process name, Z2 = arguments)\nN Test connect to SQL database (Z1 = SqlConnect String)\nO SQL Get database table scheme (Z1 = \\r delimited parameters to command)\nP SQL Get database table scheme with restrictions (Z1 = \\r delimited parameters to\ncommand)\nQ SQL execute SQL command (Z1 = \\r delimited parameters to command)\nTable 4. OwaAuth web shell command set. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\nAppendix D — Domain name parking example\nCTU researchers have observed TG-3390 parking domains by pointing their A record to a non-routable IP\nspace, including the 127.0.0.[x] loopback address. Table 5 demonstrates how the threat actors change one\nof their C2 domains to point to routable and non-routable IP addresses over time.\nStart\ndateEnd date IP change Location\n7/9/13 7/31/13 210.116.106.66 Seoul, Korea\n7/31/13 10/12/13 127.0.0.1 N/A\n10/12/13 11/5/13 122.10.10.196 Hong Kong\n11/5/13 1/12/14 198.100.107.107 California,\nU.S.\n1/12/14 3/5/14 127.0.0.1 N/A\n3/5/14 3/31/14 103.24.0.142 Hong Kong\n3/31/14 10/27/14 103.24.1.54 Hong Kong\n10/27/14 11/9/14 127.0.0.1 N/A\n11/9/14 5/25/15 127.0.0.3 N/A\n5/25/15 Current as of this\npublication127.0.0.1 N/A\nTable 5. Example parking of trendmicro-update . org (Source: Dell SecureWorks)\nEndnotes\n The Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit(TM) (CTU) research team tracks threat groups by assigning\nthem four-digit randomized numbers (3390 in this case), and compiles information from ﬁrst-hand incident\nresponse observations and from external sources.\n[1]\n Threat groups use strategic web compromises (SWCs), also known as watering hole attacks, to target a\nwide array of potential victims. Threat actors compromise a website used by their target demographic (e.g.,\ncompromising a website specializing in oil and gas industry news when targeting the energy vertical). Visitors\nto the compromised website are redirected to a server under the threat group's control, where their system\nis compromised with the threat group's malware. With this tactic, a threat group increases the likelihood of\ncompromising systems that possess desired information.\n[2]\n Enjoyed what you read?
