Symantec says it discovered the group\ntargeted two Indian government organizations, a large\ne-commerce company, one of the country's biggest\nﬁnancial groups, one of its top ﬁve IT companies, a\nshipping vendor, and a US-based healthcare provider for various Indian companies.\nExcept one privately owned company, the group spent more time attacking the two Indian\ngovernment agencies than anyone else.\n\"There is no evidence that Suckﬂy gained any beneﬁts from attacking the government\norganizations, but someone else may have beneﬁted from these attacks,\" Symantec's Joe\nDiMaggio reported. \"The nature of the Suckﬂy attacks suggests that it is unlikely that the threat\ngroup orchestrated these attacks on their own.\"\nSymantec's analysis  of Suckﬂy's mode of operation reveals cyber-warfare tactics employed by\nmany APT and economic espionage groups.\nSuckﬂy attacks start with phishing emails that deliver boobytrapped documents. These ﬁles\nexploit CVE-2014-6332 to infect the target with the Nidiran backdoor, which attackers use to\ninstall Hacktool, a password dumping utility.\nCrooks then use these passwords to scout and search the local network, gather any potentially\ninteresting data and use the backdoor again to send it oﬀ to their servers.\nSymantec noted that these attacks took place only on weekdays, when the group was sure to ﬁnd\npeople at work to read the spear-phishing emails.\nAt the moment, security researchers could not exactly tell if the group is state-sponsored or not.   Suckﬂy group mode of operation\nSuckﬂy group focused on Indian targets\nSuckﬂy uses APT-style tacticsHOT RIGHT NOW\nUS Company Develops\nSurveillance Cameras\nThat Could Help Detect\nCOVID-19:  Cameras\nfeature a thermal system\nto check body\ntemperature\nWorking from Home Amid\nCOVID-19 a No-No for\nApple Staﬀ Due to FBI-\nLike Secrecy:  Employees\nrequired to work from\nhome due to COVID-19\nPurism Announces\nDiscounts For Librem\nLinux Laptops:  The\nlaptops will ship when\nthey are back in stock\nMicrosoft Announces\nMysterious March 30\nEvent:  The whole thing\nwill obviously take place\nonline\nMicrosoft Reveals All the\nHardware Inside the Xbox\nSeries X Console:  Three\nperks deﬁne it: power,\nspeed, and compatibility\nCoronavirus Tracker\nInfects Smartphones with\nRansomware:  Virus-\ntracking app coming with\na virus of its own\nMicrosoft Launches a\nFree COVID-19 Tracker for\nDesktop and Mobile:  The\napp is available on Bing\nand also includes news\n  Click to load comments\nRelated Stories\nRussian Cyber-Espionage Group\nTargeted Angela Merkel's Party\nSouth Korea Accuses North\nKorea of Hacking Defense\nContractor\nMicrosoft Patches Internet\nExplorer Zero-Day Used in\nAttacks in South Korea\nSwiss Defense Ministry Hit by\nCyber-Attack\nSecurity Firm Exposes Secret\nIranian Cyber-Espionage\nCampaign\nFresh Reviews\nDragon Ball Z: Kakarot Review\n(PS4)\nWarcraft III: Reforged Review\n(PC)\nPillars of Eternity II: Deadﬁre\nReview Ultimate Edition (PS4)\nTicPods 2 Pro Review - Smarter AirPods (No, Really)\nSniper Ghost Warrior Contracts Review (PS4)\nLatest News\nNokia 1.3 Leaked with a Notch\nand Everything, $99 Price Tag\nExpected\nWindows 10 Cumulative Update\nKB4541331 Fixes Blue Screen\nError During Upgrade\nUS Government Goes After\nHackers Exploiting COVID-19\nFears\nMicrosoft Throttles Non-\nEssential Oﬃce 365 Features to\nAvoid Outages\nSo It Begins: Dixons Carphone\nCloses All Standalone Stores,\n2,900 Left Jobless\nUS Company Develops\nSurveillance Cameras That Could\nHelp Detect COVID-19\nGoogle Postpones Tech\nConference (Even the Digital\nVersion) Due to COVID-19\nGitHub Oﬃcially Launches\nAndroid and iPhone App\nX4: Split Vendetta Expansion\nLaunches on March 31 Alongside\n3.0 Update\n Search here...
