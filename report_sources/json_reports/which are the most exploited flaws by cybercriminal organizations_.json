Which are the most\nexploited vulnerabilities?\nTo respond to these questions let’s analyze the annual report  published by the threat\nintelligence firm Recorded Future that analyzes Top Ten vulnerabilities used by\ncrooks.\nThe report is based on the analysis of open, deep, and dark web sources; the analysts\nobserved a significant a shift in preference from Adobe to Microsoft exploits.\nSeven of the top 10 vulnerabilities exploited by phishing attacks and\nexploit kits leveraged Microsoft vulnerabilities, an inversion compared with past years\nwhich primary saw the exploitation of the Adobe Flash vulnerabilities.\nThe researchers at Recorded Future monitored the sale of the exploits in the\ncybercrime underground and dark web , the analysis does not include nation-state\nactivities because third-party suppliers of exploits to a nation-state actor avoid\ncybercriminal forum.\nAs anticipated, vulnerabilities in Microsoft software were most exploited by crooks;\nthe researchers observed that Flash exploits had dominated earlier annual reports.\n“Microsoft products provided seven of the top 10 vulnerability exploits adopted by\nexploit kits and phishing campaigns. This is in stark contrast to our previous rankings\n(2015, 2016) which saw consistent targeting of Adobe Flash exploits,”\nstates the report .\n“For the first time, three vulnerabilities remained on the list. For example, the top\nexploited vulnerability from 2016, CVE-2016-0189 in Microsoft’s Internet Explorer,\nremained a popular in-road for criminals. Dark web conversations highlighted a lack\nof new and effective browser exploits.”\nFigure 1 – Top 10 Vulnerabilities Used by Cybercriminals 2017 (Recorded Future Report)\nThe top three vulnerabilities used by cybercriminals are:\nCVE-2017-0199   allows attackers to use a specially-crafted document\nembedding an OLE2link object to spread malware such as the Dridex banking\nTrojan.\n“While labeled as an Outlook issue, this is actually bug actually stems from an\nissue within RTF files. According to published reports, the exploit uses an\nembedded OLE2link object in a specially-crafted document. It should also be\nnoted that these attacks can be thwarted by enabling Office’s Protective\nView  feature. There are updates for both Office and Windows to be applied,\nand both should be considered necessary for complete protection,”  reads\nthe Patch Tuesday analysis by the Zero Day Initiative .\nThe flaw was fixed by Microsoft in April 2017 after threat actors  had been\nexploiting it in the wild. Hackers leveraged weaponized Rich Text File (RTF)\ndocuments exploiting a flaw in Office’s Object Linking and Embedding (OLE)\ninterface to deliver malware such as the DRIDEX banking Trojan . In August\n2017, experts from Trend Micro observed crook triggering the flaw to\ndownload and execute RATMAN.EXE the command and control (C&C) server.\nThe file used by crooks was a Trojanized version of the legitimate REMCOS\nremote access tool (RAT). In April security researchers at FireEye discovered\nthat the Microsoft Word CVE-2017-0199 exploit was linked to cyber espionage\nin Ukraine conflict.  In May, Malware researchers at security firm ProofPoint\nreported the Chinese TA459 APT had exploited the CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability\nto target Financial firms. These last two cases demonstrated that nation-state\nattackers also used exploit kits in their campaigns.\nFigure 2 – CVE-2017-0199 attack exploitation (Trend Micro)\nCVE-2016-0189  is an old flaw affecting Internet Explorer that was exploited by\nattackers to drop malware.  We have reported cases in which the flaw was\ntriggered to deliver the Matrix ransomwar e, to drop Monero cryptocurrency\nMiner  in Neptune Exploit Kit or Disdain exploit kit  campaigns.\nCVE-2017-0022  is an XML Core Services information disclosure vulnerability\nthat can be exploited by attackers by tricking victims into clicking on a\nspecially crafted link.\n“An information vulnerability exists when Microsoft XML Core Services\n(MSXML)  improperly handles objects in memory. Successful exploitation of the\nvulnerability could allow the attacker to test for the presence of files on disk,”\nreads the security advisory  published by Microsoft.\n“To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could host a specially-crafted website\nthat is designed to invoke MSXML through Internet Explorer. However, an\nattacker would have no way to force a user to visit such a website. Instead, an\nattacker would typically have to convince a user to either click a link in an\nemail message or a link in an Instant Messenger request that would then take\nthe user to the website.”\nThe flaw was discovered by a joint investigation conducted by security\nresearchers at Trend Micro and ProofPoint , it was reported to Microsoft in\nSeptember 2016.\nETHICAL HACKING TRAINING – RESOURCES (INFOSEC)\nEarn your CEH,\nguaranteed!\nComplete the form below to receive course pricing.\nFIRST NAME*LAST NAME*\nEMAIL*PHONE*\nORGANIZATION INTERESTED IN STUDENT\nFINANCING?\n*\nWHO WILL FUND YOUR TRAINING?*TRAINING BUDGET*\nAccording to the security researchers at Trend Micro, the zero-day vulnerability\nhas been exploited in the AdGholas  malvertising campaign since July 2016.\nThe exploit code of the flaw was added to the Neutrino exploit kit  in\nSeptember 2016.\n“This vulnerability was used in the AdGholas malvertising campaign and later\nintegrated into the Neutrino exploit kit. CVE-2017-0022 likely replaced the\nsimilar CVE-2016-3298 and CVE-2016-3351 vulnerabilities from the same\ncampaign, which were addressed by previous patches,”  reads\nthe analysis  published by TrendMicro.\nFigure 3 – AdGholas malvertising campaign\n“An attacker exploiting CVE-2017-0022 could use phishing attacks to lure potential\ntargets to malicious websites. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow\na cybercriminal access to information on the files found in the user’s system,”\nexplained the experts from TrendMicro. “In particular, the attacker would be able to\ndetect if the system is using specific security solutions—especially ones that analyze\nmalware.”\nAccording to Recorded Future’s report, in 2017 the researchers have observed a\nsignificant drop in the development of new exploit kits.\nThe experts noticed a 62 percent decline in the development of exploit kits, they\nobserved only a few new EKs in the threat landscape, including AKBuilder, Disdain ,\nand Terror EK . The experts pointed out that multiple factors have caused the drop,\nincluding more specific victim targeting, shifts to more secure browsers, and a rise\nin cryptocurrency mining malware likely led to the decline.\n“Overall, exploit kits are declining as criminal efforts have adapted. This comes as\ncryptocurrency mining malware popularity rose in the past year,”  continues the\nreport.\nThe report states that in 2017 the number of new exploit kits was 10 out of a total list\nof 158 EKs, experts highlighted that the drop-in exploit kit activity also overlaps with\nthe decline of Flash Player usage, many EKs included the codes to trigger the flaws\nin Adobe products.\nAccording to the experts, users have shifted to more secure web browsers making\nhard for attackers the development of new efficient exploit kits.\nAnother element that influenced the drop of the EK was the spikes in cryptocurrency\nmining malware that were more profitable for crooks.\nThe researchers also investigated how the malware exploited the flaws and how\ncrooks used them.\nThe vulnerability CVE-2017-0199 was heavily used in phishing campaigns; Recorded\nFuture linked it to 11 distinct strain of malware during 2017.\nThe second most frequently used vulnerability, CVE-2016-0189, was associated with\nthe RIG exploit kit  to deliver ransomware.\nLet’s close with the analysis of the economic value of exploit codes for top\n2017 vulnerabilities. It was quite easy to find high, and low-quality exploit kit in the\nDark web  forums and marketplaces , with prices ranging from $80 per day for\nservices to $25,000 for full source-code access.\n“In November 2017, we observed Stegano (Astrum) exploit kit offered for unlimited\nusage at rates of $2,000 per day or $15,000 per month (Image 6). Stegano leveraged\nsix of the 10 exploits in our report.”\nIt is also interesting to note that Exploit builders for Microsoft Office vulnerability\nCVE-2017-0199 ranged from $400 to $800 in 2017. Purchasing such an exploit\nbuilder could support the creation of a payload for a phishing attack.\nNow that we know which were the most exploited vulnerabilities in 2017 let’s adopt\nall necessary countermeasures to prevent further attacks in the incoming months.\nReferences\nhttps://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2018-0327.pdf\nhttps://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/62028/cyber-crime/powerpoint-slide-show-\nexploit.html\nhttp://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/57947/hacking/microsoft-patch-tuesday.html\nhttps://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/57985/cyber-crime/cve-2017-0199-finspy-\nspyware.html\nhttps://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/58692/malware/ta459-apt-targets-financial-\nfirms.html\nhttps://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/57408/cyber-crime/cve-2017-0022-flaw-\nadgholas.html\nTweet    \nreddit\n \nAUTHOR\nPierluigi\nPaganiniPierluigi Paganini is CTO at Cybaze Enterprise SpA\nPierluigi is member of the ENISA (European Union\nAgency for Network and Information Security) Threat\nLandscape Stakeholder Group, member of Cyber G7\nWorkgroup of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and\nInternational Cooperation, Professor and Director of the\nMaster in Cyber Security at the Link Campus University.\nHe is also a Security Evangelist, Security Analyst and\nFreelance Writer.
