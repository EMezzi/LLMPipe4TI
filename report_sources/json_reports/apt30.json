They primarily target victims in Southeast Asia and India, possibly\nincluding classified government networks. Decoy documents on spear phishing emails tend toward topics related to\nIndia, Southeast Asia, border areas, and security and diplomatic issues in those areas. Of particular note, they have\nmanaged their operations well enough to continue using the same tools, tactics, and infrastructure over that period.\nTTPs\nThey generally target sensitive data for exfiltration, rather than pursuing direct financial reward.\nThey have developed tools to attack air-gapped networks.\nThey frequently register their own CnC domains. Some have been in use for years.\nContinuous automatic updating of the malware after infection.\nSpear phishing emails often appear to originate with governmental agencies, and target both personal and\norganizational email accounts of the intended victims.\nProtocols Used\nHTTP (80/tcp)\nHTTPS (443/tcp)APT30 https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/collection/APT30-de76b1142bfc...\n1 of 3 17-Mar-20, 14:30FTP (21/tcp)\nMalware Used\nThe APT30 threat actor uses a variety of malware in its campaigns.\nBackdoor.Win32.Backspace.A (http://telussecuritylabs.com/threats/show/TSL20150414-18) (ZJ and ZR\nversions) (a/k/a Lecna) -- Backdoor\nNetEagle (Scout and Norton versions) -- Backdoor\nShipShape -- Air-Gap Bridge\nSpaceShip -- Air-Gap Bridge\nFlashFlood -- Air-Gap Bridge\nMilkmaid\nOrangeade\nCreamsicle\nBackbend\nGemCutter\nAdditional Indicators\nMD5\nReferences\nAPT30 and the Mechanics of a Long-Running Cyber Espionage Operation (https://www2.fireeye.com/rs/fireye\n/images/rpt-apt30.pdf.)
