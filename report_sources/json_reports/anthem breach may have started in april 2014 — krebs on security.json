In November 2014,\nCrowdstrike published a snapshot of a graphic showing the malware and malicious Internet\nservers used in what security experts at PriceWaterhouseCoopers  dubbed the ScanBox\nFramework , a suite of tools that have been used to launch a number of cyber espionage\nattacks.\nA Maltego transform published by CrowdStrike. The graphic is intended to illustrate some tools and Internet\nservers thought to be closely tied to a Chinese cyber espionage group that CrowdStrike calls “Deep Panda.”\nCrowdstrike’s snapshot (produced with the visualization tool Maltego ) lists many of the tools\nthe company has come to associate with activity linked to Deep Panda, including a password\nstealing Trojan horse program called Derusbi , and an Internet address —\n198[dot]200[dot]45[dot]112.\nCrowdStrike’s image curiously redacts the resource tied to that Internet address (note the\nblack box in the image above), but a variety of open source records indicate that this particular\naddress was until very recently the home for a very interesting domain: we11point.com . The\nthird and fourth characters in that domain name are the numeral one, but it appears that\nwhoever registered the domain was attempting to make it look like “Wellpoint,” the former\nname of Anthem before the company changed its corporate name in late 2014.\nWe11point[dot]com was registered on April 21, 2014 to a bulk domain registration service in\nChina. Eight minutes later , someone changed the site’s registration records to remove any\ntrace of a connection to China.\nIntrigued by the fake Wellpoint domains,  Rich Barger , chief information officer for\nArlington, Va. security firm ThreatConnect Inc. , dug deeper into so-called “passive DNS”\nrecords — historic records of the mapping between numeric Internet addresses and domain\nnames. That digging revealed a host of other subdomains tied to the suspicious\nwe11point[dot]com site. In the process, Barger discovered that these subdomains\n— including  myhr.we11point[dot]com , and hrsolutions.we11point[dot]com\n– mimicked components of Wellpoint’s actual network as it existed in April 2014.\n“We were able to verify that the evil we11point infrastructure is constructed to masquerade\nas legitimate Wellpoint infrastructure,” Barger said.\nAnother fishy subdomain that Barger discovered was extcitrix.we11point[dot]com . The\n“citrix” portion of that domain likely refers to Citrix , a software tool that many large\ncorporations commonly use to allow employees remote access to internal networks over a\nvirtual private network (VPN).\nInterestingly, that extcitrix.we11point[dot]com domain, first put online on April 22, 2014, was\nreferenced in a malware scan from a malicious file that someone uploaded to malware scanning\nservice Virustotal.com . According to the writeup on that malware , it appears to be a\nbackdoor program masquerading as Citrix VPN software. The malware is digitally signed with\na certificate issued to an organization called DTOPTOOLZ Co.  According to CrowdStrike and\nother security firms, that digital signature is the calling card of the Deep Panda Chinese\nespionage group.\nCONNECTIONS TO OTHER VICTIMS?\nAs noted in a story  in HealthITSecurity.com, Anthem has been sharing information about the\nattack with the Health Information Trust Alliance  (HITRUST) and the National\nHealth Information Sharing and Analysis Center  (NH-ISAC), industry groups whose\nmission is to disseminate information about cyber threats to the healthcare industry.\nA news alert published by HITRUST last week notes that Anthem has been sharing so-called\n“indicators of compromise” (IOCs) — Internet addresses, malware signatures and other\ninformation associated with the breach. “It was quickly determined that the IOCs were not\nfound by other organizations across the industry and this attack was targeted a specific\norganization,” HITRUST wrote in its alert. “Upon further investigation and analysis it is\nbelieved to be a targeted advanced persistent threat (APT) actor. With that information,\nHITRUST determined it was not necessary to issue a broad industry alert.”\nAn alert released by the Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST) about the APT attack on Anthem.\nBut a variety of data points suggest that the same infrastructure used to attack Anthem may\nhave been leveraged against a Reston, Va.-based information technology firm that primarily\nserves the Department of Defense.\nA writeup  on a piece of malware that Symantec calls “Mivast” was produced on Feb. 6, 2015. It\ndescribes a backdoor Trojan that Symantec says may call out to one of a half-dozen domains,\nincluding the aforementioned extcitrix.we11point[dot]com domain and another —\nsharepoint-vaeit.com . Other domains on the same server include ssl-vaeit.com , and\nwiki-vaeit.com . Once again, it appears that we have a malware sample calling home to a\ndomain designed to mimic the internal network of an organization — most likely VAE\nInc. (whose legitimate domain is vaeit.com).\nBarger and his team at ThreatConnect discovered that the sharepoint-vaeit.com domain also\nwas tied to a malware sample made to look like it was VPN software made by networking giant\nJuniper . That malware was created in May 2014, and was also signed with the DTOPTOOLZ\nCo. digital certificate that CrowdStrike has tied to Deep Panda.\nIn response to an inquiry from KrebsOnSecurity, VAE said it detected a targeted phishing\nattack in May 2014 that used malware which phoned home to those domains, but the company\nsaid it was not aware of any successful compromise of its users.\nIn any case, the Symantec writeup on Mivast also says the malware tries to contact the\nInternet address 192[dot]199[dot]254[dot]126, which resolved to just one Web domain:\ntopsec2014[dot]com . That domain was registered on May 6, 2014 to a bulk domain reseller\nwho immediately changed the registration records and assigned the domain to the email\naddress topsec_2014@163.com . That address appears to be the personal email of one Song\nYubo , a professor with the Information Security Research Center  at the Southeast University\nin Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.\nYubo and his university were named in a March 2012 report, “ Occupying the Information High\nGround: Chinese Capabilities for Computer Network Operations and Cyber Espionage ,” (PDF)\nproduced by U.S. defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp.  for the U.S.-China\nEconomic and Security Review Commission . According to the report, Yubo’s center is\none of a handful of civilian universities in China that receive funding from the Chinese\ngovernment to conduct sensitive research and development with information security and\ninformation warfare applications.\nANALYSIS\nOf course, it could well be that this is all a strange coincidence, and/or that the basic\ninformation on Deep Panda is flawed. But that seems unlikely given the number of connections\nand patterns emerging in just this small data set.\nIt’s remarkable that the security industry so seldom learns from past mistakes. For example,\none of the more confounding and long-running problems in the field of malware detection and\nprevention is the proliferation of varying names for the same threat. We’re seeing this once\nagain with the nicknames assigned to various cyberespionage groups (see the second\nparagraph of this story for examples).\nIt’s also incredible that so many companies could see the outlines of a threat against such a\nhuge target, and that it took until just this past week for the target to become aware of it. For its\npart, ThreatConnect tweeted about its findings  back in November 2014, and shared the\ninformation out to its user base.\nCrowdStrike declined to confirm whether the resource blanked out in the above pictured\ngraphic from November 2014  was in fact we11point[dot]com.\n“What I can tell you is that this domain is a Deep Panda domain, and that we always try to alert\nvictims whenever we discover them,” said Dmitri Alperovitch , co-founder of CrowdStrike.\nAlso, it’s myopic for an industry information sharing and analysis center (ISAC) to decide not\nto share indicators of compromise with other industry ISACs, let alone its own members. This\nshould not be a siloed effort. Somehow, we need to figure out a better — more timely way — to\nshare threat intelligence and information across industries.\nPerhaps the answer is crowdsourcing threat intelligence , or maybe it’s something we haven’t\nthought of yet. But one thing is clear: there is a yawning gap between the time it takes for an\nadversary to compromise a target and the length of time that typically passes before the victim\nfigures out they’ve been had.\nThe most staggering and telling statistic included in Verizon’s 2014 Data Breach Investigations\nReport  (well worth a read) is the graphic showing the difference between the “time to\ncompromise” and the “time to discovery.” TL;DR: That gap is not improving, but instead is\nwidening.\nThen again, maybe this breach at Anthem isn’t as bad as it seems. After all, if the above data\nand pundits are to be believed, the attackers were likely looking for a needle in a haystack —\nsearching for data on a few individuals that might give Chinese spies a way to better siphon\nmilitary technology or infiltrate some U.S. defense program.\nPerhaps, as Barger wryly observed, the Anthem breach was little more than the product of a\nclass assignment — albeit an expensive and aggravating one for Anthem and its 80 million\naffected members. In May 2014, the aforementioned Southeast University Professor Song\nYubo posted a “Talent Cup” tournament challenge to his information security students .\n“Just as the OSS [ Office of Strategic Services ] and CIA used professors to recruit spies, it could\nbe that this was all just a class project,” Barger mused.\nTags: Axiom , Citrix , CrowdStrike , Deep Panda , DTOPTOOLZ Co. , Group 72 , HITRUST , Maltego , NH-ISAC ,\nPriceWaterhouseCoopers , Rich Barger , ScanBox Framework , Shell_Crew , Song Yubo , ThreatConnect ,\ntopsec_2014@163.com , virustotal , we11point\n56 comments \nMailing List\nSubscribe here\nRecent Posts\nCoronavirus Widens the Money\nMule Pool\nThe Web’s Bot Containment Unit\nNeeds Your Help\nLive Coronavirus Map Used to\nSpread Malware\nCrafty Web Skimming Domain\nSpoofs “https”\nMicrosoft Patch Tuesday, March\n2020 Edition\nAll About Skimmers\nClick image for my skimmer series.\nSpam Nation\nA New York Times Bestseller!\nThe Value of a Hacked PC\nBadguy uses for your PC\nTools for a Safer PC\nTools for a Safer PC\nThe Pharma Wars\nSpammers Duke it Out\nBadguy Uses for Your Email\nYour email account may be worth\nfar more than you imagine.\neBanking Best Practices\neBanking Best Practices for\nBusinesses\nMost Popular Posts\nSextortion Scam Uses Recipient's\nHacked Passwords  (1076)\nOnline Cheating Site\nAshleyMadison Hacked  (798)\nSources: Target Investigating Data\nBreach  (620)\nCards Stolen in Target Breach\nFlood Underground Markets  (445)\nReports: Liberty Reserve Founder\nArrested, Site Shuttered  (416)\nWas the Ashley Madison Database\nLeaked?

So we\nhave that going for us.\nKelly Jackson Higgins:\n“Anthem isn’t a member of the healthcare industry’s information sharing and analysis\ncenter, the NH-ISAC, so the NH-ISAC got word of the attack via other members of the\nthreat information-sharing community the morning after Anthem reported its massive data\nbreach.\n…Anthem’s attack, while targeted, in many ways was very similar to others out there in its\nmethods and approach.”\nhttp://www.darkreading.com/analytics/threat-intelligence/how-anthem-shared-key-\nmarkers-of-its-cyberattack/d/d-id/1319083 ?\nJeff\nFebruary 13, 2015 at 5:03 pm\nDid Rich Barger/ThreatConnect ever contact Wellpoint/Anthem with the knowledge that\npotential Chinese hackers were attempting to masquerade as Wellpoint?Advertisement\n "
