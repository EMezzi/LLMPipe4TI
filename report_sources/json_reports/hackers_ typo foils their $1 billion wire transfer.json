Attackers successfully\nbreached Bangladesh Bank's systems and stole its credentials for payment\ntransfers, yet the small typo they made in a wire transfer request ultimately\nundid their efforts to steal $1 billion.\nAs Reuters reports today , after obtaining the credentials, attackers\n\"bombarded the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with nearly three dozen\nrequests to move money from the Bangladesh Bank's account there to\nentities in the Philippines and Sri Lanka.\"\nThe first four transfers, totaling about $81 million, went through, but the fifth\ntime: \nHackers misspelled \"foundation\" in the NGO's name as \"fandation,\"\nprompting a routing bank, Deutsche Bank, to seek clarification from the\nBangladesh central bank, which stopped the transaction, one of the\nofficials said.\nThis, plus the number and size of the transfers being sent to private entities\ninstead of other banks raised the suspicions of The Fed. Although the initial\n$80 million was not recovered, between $850 to $870 million of attempted\ntransactions were stopped.\nRead more at Reuters .\nDark Reading's Quick Hits delivers a brief synopsis and summary of the\nsignificance of breaking news events.

Keep them distracted with the 800 million\ntransaction while they clear up loose ends and make off with the 80 million\ntransaction... Yeah, I don't think it was a mistake..

It seems like irony is\nanother given. At least I've seen it many times in the past and continue to see it, even\ntoday. It's definitely ironic that the hackers probably spent a lot of time to figure out\nexactly how to hack into the Bangladesh bank only to see a significant portion of their\nefforts wasted due to a spelling mistake. In addition, it seems strange that while the\nbank's network was breached through a Hi-Tech exploit, a simple low tech request for\nspelling clarification/validation resulted in foiling a significant financial portion of the\nplot.\nREPLY   |  POST MESSAGE   |  MESSAGES LIST   |  START A BOARD\nRyanSepe ,\nUser Rank: Ninja\n3/11/2016 | 2:47:25 PM\nGroup \nI know this fairly new but has this been tracked to a group/individual or has there been\nany data scraped to suggest origin of the attack?\nREPLY   |  POST MESSAGE   |  MESSAGES LIST   |  START A BOARD\nRyanSepe ,\nUser Rank: Ninja\n3/11/2016 | 2:45:43 PM\nRe: c'mon...makes you think that their cat jumped on the keyboard.
