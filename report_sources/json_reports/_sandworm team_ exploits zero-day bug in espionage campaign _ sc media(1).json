The group crafts fairly well formatted emails that are of interest to the victim, he said, explaining the messages typically\ncontain an attachment that, when opened, exploits a vulnerability and delivers BlackEnergy malware.\nBlackEnergy is a plugin-based trojan, meaning plugins can be written and used for nearly any purpose, including keylogging, audio recording, and\nscreenshot grabbing, Robinson said. Sandworm Team uses variants of the malware referred to as BlackEnergy 2 and BlackEnergy 3, or BlackEnergy Lite,\nHultquist said.\n“What’s different from [other groups is] what’s being taken here,” Hultquist said. “They’re taking email, they’re taking documents, they’re taking\nknowledge – not data. It’s about esoteric knowledge an attacker can take to gain an advantage.”\nAmong the exploits being used by Sandworm Team to deliver BlackEnergy and gain footholds in organizations is CVE-2014-4114 , a zero-day\nvulnerability in Windows OLE that impacts multiple versions of the operating system and could enable remote code execution. On Tuesday, Microsoft\naddressed the issue , which was deemed fairly dangerous by Robinson.\nOther vulnerabilities being used include CVE-2010-3333, CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2013-3906, and CVE-2014-1761, all of which enable the group to\nremotely execute arbitrary code, according to the report, which adds that WinRAR bug OSVDB-62610 was also exploited.\nSandworm Team has been operating since 2009 and has stayed under the radar for so long due to careful planning, which includes compressing and\nencrypting their malware and employing HTTPS to hide their traffic, Robinson said. Hultquist added that access to a zero-day vulnerability helps.\n“I think it’s possible that they have access to other zero-day’s,” Hultquist said.\nTOPICS:  CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE  CYBER ESPIONAGE  GOVERNMENT  MALWARE  PATCH  RESEARCH\nRelated Articles\nGroup infects more than 500K systems, targets\nbanking credentials in U.S.APT ‘Nitro’ group attacks again in 2014 ‘Moafee’ and ‘DragonOK’ APT groups leverage\nsimilar attack tools, techniques\nMOST POPULAR\nPopular Emailed Recent\nCoronavirus, Trump threats,\ngeopolitical campaigns - how they\naffect your business & what you\nshould do\nCymatic offers free cybersecurity tool\nfor schools for remote learning\nCoronavirus tracking app locks up\nAndroid phones for ransom\nCheckmarx sold for $1.15 billion\nYears-long malware operation hides\nnjRAT in cracked hacking tools\nAbout Us\nSC Corporate News\nMeet the Team\nAdvisory Board\nContact Us\n   PRODUCT REVIEW\nAbout Product Review\nGroup Tests\nFAQ\nLicensing & Product Reviews\nUSER CENTER\nVideos\nExecutive Insight Guidelines\nSubscribe\nEditorial CalendarOTHER SC SITES\nRiskSec Conference\nSC Resource Library\nSC Online Events\nSC Awards\nCopyright © 2020 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed in any form without prior authorization.\nYour use of this website constitutes acceptance of CyberRisk Alliance Privacy Policy  and Terms & Conditions .Back to Top COMPANY INFONEWS REVIEWS IN DEPTH EVENTS RESOURCE LIBRARY SC SECURITY OPS CENTER SC UK Search...\n "
