It's a fact now and bankers\nacross the globe should realize sooner then later\nAuthor:\nJune 13, 2018 / 12:19 pm\n2:30  minute read\nShare this article:Tara Seals\n\nThe wiper malware affecting 9,000 workstations and 500 servers inside\nChile’s largest financial institution turns out to have been a distraction.\nA cyberattack against Chile’s largest financial institution last month, which\nreportedly destroyed 9,000 workstations and 500 servers, was actually cover for a larger\nplot to compromise endpoints handling transactions on the SWIFT network. When the dust\nsettled on the attacks, investigators said $10 million was stolen from Banco de Chile and\nfunneled off to an account in Hong Kong.\nOn Sunday, the bank’s general manager Eduardo Ebensperger told Chilean media outlet\nPulso  that the late-May attack  allowed adversaries to complete four separate fraudulent\ntransactions on the SWIFT system before the heist was discovered.\n“We found some strange transactions in the SWIFT system (where banks internationally\nremit their transactions to different countries),” Ebensperger told the outlet. “There we\nrealized that the virus was not necessarily the underlying issue, but apparently [the attackers]\nwanted to defraud the bank.”\nThe initial attack was carried out using a wiper malware  that Ebensperger described as a\n“zero-day virus ” that had never been seen in the wild. However, in report published Tuesday\nby  Flashpoint, analysts discovered that the code is actually a modified version of the Buhtrap\nmalware component known as kill_os. The module renders the local operating system and\nthe Master Boot Record (MBR) unreadable by erasing them.\nAfter reverse-engineering the codebase, Flashpoint analysts found that the Chile-attack\nmalware, dubbed “MBR Killer,” was identical with only minor modifications to Buhtrap’s\nkill_os. For instance, the Buhtrap code, which was leaked onto the Dark Web in February,\ncontains an almost identical Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) script as the unpacked\nBanco de Chile malware (NSIS is an open-source system used to build Windows installers).\nThis revelation could potentially help with attribution: The Buhtrap malware and its\ncomponents, including MBR Killer, were previously used by a Russian-speaking hacker\ncollective in attacks against multiple financial institutions in Russia and the Ukraine,\nFlashpoint noted.\nHowever, the attribution behind the Banco de Chile attack remains uncertain.\n“It is notable, however, that Chilean financial institutions were targeted entities by the\nLazarus Group, which was linked to North Korea, during the compromise of the Polish\nFinancial Supervision Authority website in 2017,” Vitali Kremez, director of research, told\nThreatpost in an interview. “More specifically, the breached website was filtered to serve\npayloads to only targeted IP ranges associated with financial institutions of interest to the\ngroup.”\nHe added, “the above-referenced indicators point to two possible groups behind –\npurported North-Korean affiliated group Lazarus and the known Russian-speaking\nsophisticated criminal group  Buhtrap.”\nIt’s also possible, researchers said, that it’s an entirely different copycat group making use\nof Buhtrap’s leaked source code.\nMeanwhile, Ebensperger said that a forensic analysis conducted by Microsoft attributed the\nattack to either Eastern European or Asian groups. Further, Ofer Israeli, CEO of Illusive\nNetworks, said via email that he too believes the North Korea-linked Lazarus Group, which\nis thought to have carried out the SWIFT attacks in Bangladesh  in 2016, is behind it all.\n“Targeting financial organizations is part of their long-term strategy and compromising\nglobal financial networks via small to medium-sized banks in Central and South America\nwhose cyber-defenses may be less sophisticated poses a higher probability of success,” he\nexplained.\nIn any event, Banco de Chile is the latest victim in a string of cyber-attacks targeting\npayment transfer systems. For instance, in May, Somewhere between $18 million to $20\nmillion went missing  during unauthorized interbank money transfers in Mexico’s central\nbanking system.\n“Third-party providers of payment and transfer systems have become one of the most\neffective attack vectors for hackers trying to siphon money from banks,” said Fred Kneip,\nCEO at CyberGRX, via email. “We’ve seen the SWIFT Network under attack for years now,\nand just last month hackers targeted the Mexican central bank SPEI interbank transfer\nsystem.”\nHe added, “A large international bank has tens of thousands of third parties in their digital\necosystem, but hackers have figured out that it only takes one weak link to make millions of\ndollars. Understanding the level of risk exposure introduced by all third parties is important,\nbut that becomes even more critical for a Tier 1 partner like a transfer system provider.”\n \n \nShare this article:\nHacks\n Malware\nAPT36 Taps Coronavirus as\n‘Golden Opportunity’ to\nSpread Crimson RAT\nThe Pakistani-linked APT has been\nspotted infecting victims with data\nexfiltration malware.\nMarch 17, 2020\nActivities of a Nigerian\nCybercriminal Uncovered\nRise and fall of a Nigerian cybercriminal\ncalled ‘Dton,’ who made hundreds of\nthousands of dollars in a 7-year\ncampaign, outlined in new report.\nMarch 17, 2020\nCoronavirus-Themed APT\nAttack Spreads Malware\nThe APT group was spotted sending\nspear-phishing emails that purport to\ndetail information about coronavirus –\nbut they actually infect victims with a\ncustom RAT.\nMarch 13, 2020\nAmbarish\nA Practical Guide to Zero-Trust\nSecurity\nJanuary 15, 2020  2\n7 Tips for Maximizing Your SOC\nDecember 31, 2019  5\nMean Time to Hardening: The Next-\nGen Security Metric\nDecember 30, 2019  4\nCombining AI and Playbooks to\nPredict Cyberattacks\nDecember 26, 2019  1\nThe Case for Cyber-Risk Prospectuses\nDecember 24, 2019  1\nNewsletter\nSubscribe to Threatpost Today  \nJoin thousands of people who receive the\nlatest breaking cybersecurity news every day.\nSubscribe now\nTwitter\n fixed three high-severity \n vulnerabilities in its SD-WAN\nsolutions for business users.\n33 mins ago\nFollow @threatpost\n#Cisco\n#security\nhttps://t.co/6tYwrGTHRP\nThe First Stop For Security News Home\n About Us\n Contact Us\n Advertise With Us\n RSS FeedsCopyright © 2020 Threatpost Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Advertise\nBlack Hat Breaking News Cloud Security Critical Infrastructure Cryptography Facebook\nSUGGESTED ARTICLES\nDISCUSSIONINFOSEC INSIDER\nSubscribe to our newsletter, Threatpost Today !
