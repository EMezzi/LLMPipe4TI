The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who\nsuccessfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install\nprograms; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\nIn a web‐based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked \"safe for initialization\" in\nan application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user‐provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content\nthat could exploit the vulnerability.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the scripting engine handles objects in memory.\nExploitability Assessment\nThe following table provides an exploitability assessment  for this vulnerability at the time of original publication.\nPublicly Disclosed Exploited Latest Software Release Older Software Release Denial of Service\nNo Yes 0 ‐ Exploitation Detected 0 ‐ Exploitation Detected Not Applicable\nSecurity Updates\nProduct Platform Article Download Impact Severity Supersedence\nInternet Explorer 10 Windows Server 2012 3154070 Security Update Remote Code Execution Moderate 3148198\nInternet Explorer 11 Windows 8.1 for 32‐bit systems 3154070 Security Update Remote Code Execution Critical 3148198\nInternet Explorer 11 Windows 8.1 for x64‐based systems 3154070 Security Update Remote Code Execution Critical 3148198\nInternet Explorer 11 Windows Server 2012 R2 3154070 Security Update Remote Code Execution Moderate 3148198\nInternet Explorer 11 Windows RT 8.1 3154070 Security Update Remote Code Execution Critical 3148198\nInternet Explorer 11 Windows 7 for 32‐bit Systems Service Pack 1 3154070 Security Update Remote Code Execution Critical 3148198\nInternet Explorer 11 Windows 7 for x64‐based Systems Service Pack 1 3154070 Security Update Remote Code Execution Critical 3148198\nInternet Explorer 11 Windows Server 2008 R2 for x64‐based Systems Service Pack 1 3154070 Security Update Remote Code Execution Moderate 3148198\nInternet Explorer 11 Windows 10 for 32‐bit Systems 3156387 Security Update Remote Code Execution Critical 3147461\nInternet Explorer 11 Windows 10 for x64‐based Systems 3156387 Security Update Remote Code Execution Critical 3147461\nInternet Explorer 11 Windows 10 Version 1511 for 32‐bit Systems 3156421 Security Update Remote Code Execution Critical 3147458\nInternet Explorer 11 Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64‐based Systems 3156421 Security Update Remote Code Execution Critical 3147458\nInternet Explorer 9 Windows Vista x64 Edition Service Pack 2 3154070 Security Update Remote Code Execution Critical 3148198\nInternet Explorer 9 Windows Vista Service Pack 2 3154070 Security Update Remote Code Execution Critical 3148198\nInternet Explorer 9 Windows Server 2008 for 32‐bit Systems Service Pack 2 3154070 Security Update Remote Code Execution Moderate 3148198\nInternet Explorer 9 Windows Server 2008 for x64‐based Systems Service Pack 2 3154070 Security Update Remote Code Execution Moderate 3148198\nWindows Server 2008 for 32‐bit Systems Service Pack 2 3158991 Security Update Remote Code Execution Moderate 3124624\nWindows Server 2008 for 32‐bit Systems Service Pack 2 ﴾Server Core installation﴿ 3158991 Security Update Remote Code Execution Moderate 3124624\nWindows Server 2008 for Itanium‐Based Systems Service Pack 2 3158991 Security Update Remote Code Execution Moderate 3124624\nWindows Server 2008 for x64‐based Systems Service Pack 2 3158991 Security Update Remote Code Execution Moderate 3124624\nWindows Server 2008 for x64‐based Systems Service Pack 2 ﴾Server Core installation﴿ 3158991 Security Update Remote Code Execution Moderate 3124624\nWindows Server 2008 R2 for x64‐based Systems Service Pack 1 ﴾Server Core installation﴿ 3155413 Security Update Remote Code Execution Moderate 3124625\nWindows Vista Service Pack 2 3158991 Security Update Remote Code Execution Critical 3124624\nWindows Vista x64 Edition Service Pack 2 3158991 Security Update Remote Code Execution Critical 3124624\nMitigations\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors  for this vulnerability.\nWorkarounds\nRestrict access to VBScript.dll and JScript.dll  For 32‐bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:\n takeown /f %windir%\\system32\\vbscript.dll \n cacls %windir%\\system32\\vbscript.dll /E /P everyone:N\n cacls %windir%\\system32\\jscript.dll /E /P everyone:N\nFor 64‐bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:\n takeown /f %windir%\\syswow64\\vbscript.dll \n cacls %windir%\\syswow64\\vbscript.dll /E /P everyone:N\n cacls %windir%\\syswow64\\jscript.dll /E /P everyone:N\nImpact of Workaround .

CVE‐2016‐0187 and CVE‐2016‐0189 are vulnerabilities in the JScript and VBScript engines. Although the attack vector is through Internet Explorer, the\nvulnerabilities are addressed by the updates released in this bulletin ﴾MS16‐051 ﴿for systems running Internet Explorer 9, Internet Explorer 10, and Internet Explorer 11. For Internet Explorer 7 and earlier, the vulnerabilities are addressed by the updates described in MS16‐053 .\nI am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?  Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012\nR2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as En hanced Security Configuration . Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor\nfor websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.\nCan EMET help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities?  Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit ﴾EMET ﴿enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET\ncan help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.\nFor more information about EMET, see the  Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit .\nWhy do I see both JScript.dll and VBScript.dll in the packages for this cumulative security update?  This security update ships as a cumulative update for the JScript and VBScript scripting engines. While both engines are included in this release, the components affected by the security fixes covered by this bulletin are\nlisted above in the section Affected Software .\nHow do I determine which versions of JScript and VBScript scripting engines are installed on my system?  The JScript and VBScript scripting engines are installed with supported releases of Microsoft Windows. In addition, installing a newer version of Internet Explorer on a system can change the versions of the\nJScript and VBScript scripting engines that are installed.\nTo determine which versions of the JScript or VBScript scripting engines are installed on your system, perform the following steps:\n1. Open Windows Explorer.\n2. Navigate to the %systemroot%\\system32  directory.\n3. For VBScript, right‐click vbscript.dll , select Properties , and then click the Details  tab.\n4. For JScript, right‐click jscript.dll , select Properties, and then click the Details  tab.\nThe version number is listed in the File Version  field. If your file version starts with 5.8, for example 5.8.7600.16385, then VBScript 5.8 is installed on your system.\nOnce I know the versions of the JScript or VBScript scripting engine installed on my system, where do I get the update?  The affected software in this bulletin apply to systems without Internet Explorer installed and to systems with Internet Explorer 7 or earlier versions installed. Customers with systems running\nInternet Explorer 8 or later should apply the Internet Explorer Cumulative Update ﴾ MS16‐051  ,﴿which also addresses the vulnerabilities discussed in this bulletin.\nAcknowledgements\nMicrosoft recognizes the efforts of those in the security community who help us protect customers through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.\nSee acknowledgements  for more information.\nDisclaimer\nThe information provided in the Microsoft Knowledge Base is provided \"as is\" without warranty of any kind.
