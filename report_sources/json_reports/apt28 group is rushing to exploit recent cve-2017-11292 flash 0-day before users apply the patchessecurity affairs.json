We attributed this attack to APT28 (also known\nas Sofacy), a Russian state-sponsored group.” states the report  published by Proofpoint.\n“Targeting data for this campaign is limited but some emails were sent to foreign government entities equivalent\nto the State Department and private-sector businesses in the aerospace industry. The known geographical\ntargeting appears broad, including Europe and the United States. The emails were sent from free email services.”\nThe patch was released on Monday, October 16, at that time Kaspersky detected attacks leveraging\nthe CVE-2017-11292 allegedly conducted by the BlackOasis APT group .\nResearchers believe that APT28 was also in possession of the exploit (whether purchased, discovered\non their own, or reverse engineered from the BlackOasis attack), and is trying to use it in targeted\nattacks.\nThe APT28  rushed to assemble the exploit and the distribution campaign, reusing code from past\nattacks, the APT28 hackers did the same in May after Microsoft patched three zero-days\nflaws  exploited by the Russian APT group.\nBack to the present, researchers believe the APT28 found a way to exploit the CVE-2017-11292, it is\nunclear if they purchased the zero-day or reverse engineered it from the BlackOasis attack.\nThe researchers noticed that the recent attacks exploiting the CVE-2017-11292 flaw employed the\nsame old DealersChoice malware , a Flash exploit framework also used by the APT28 group against\nMontenegro.\nWhen the target user opens these the weaponized files, DealersChoice contacts the remote server to\ndownload the CVE-2017-11292 exploit code and execute it.\n“The document “World War 3.docx” contacts DealersChoice.B, APT28’s attack framework that allows loading\nexploit code on-demand  from a command and control (C&C) server. DealersChoice  has previously been used\nto exploit a variety of Flash vulnerabilities, including CVE-2015-7645, CVE-2016-1019, CVE-2016-4117, and\nCVE-2016-7855 via embedded objects in crafted Microsoft Word documents.” continues the report.\nThe Proofpoint researcher Kafeine, confirmed his company currently trying to take down C&C\nservers associated with the DealersChoice attack framework used in the CVE-2017-11292 attacks.\n“APT28 appears to be moving rapidly to exploit this newly documented vulnerability before the available patch is\nwidely deployed. Because Flash is still present on a high percentage of systems and this vulnerability affects all\nmajor operating systems, it is critical that organizations and end users apply the Adobe patch immediately.  ”\nconcluded Proofpoint.\nFurther technical details are available in the report  published by Proofpoint, including the IOCs.\nPierluigi Paganini\n(Securi ty Affairs  – APT28, cyber espionage)\nAdobe Flash CVE-2017-11292 cyber espionage malware Russia state-sponsored hackingShare this...\n\n Copyright 2015 Security Affairs by Pierluigi Paganini All Right Reserved.
