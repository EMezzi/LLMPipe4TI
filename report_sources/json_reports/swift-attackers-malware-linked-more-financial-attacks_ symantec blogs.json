The attacks can be traced back as far as October\n2015, two months prior to the discovery of the failed attack in Vietnam, which was hitherto the\nearliest known incident.\nThe attack against the Bangladesh central bank triggered an alert by payments network SWIFT\n(https://www.swift.com/insights/press-releases/swift-comments-on-malware-reports), after it was\nfound the attackers had used malware to cover up evidence of fraudulent transfers. SWIFT issued a\nfurther warning (https://www.swift.com/insights/press-releases/swift-customer-\ncommunication_customer-security-issues), saying that it had found evidence of malware being\nused against another bank in a similar fashion. Vietnam’s Tien Phong Bank subsequently stated\n(http://www.reuters.com/article/us-vietnam-cybercrime-idUSKCN0Y60EN) that it intercepted a\nfraudulent transfer of over $1 million in the fourth quarter of last year. SWIFT concluded that the\nsecond attack indicates that a “wider and highly adaptive campaign” is underway targeting banks.\nA third bank, Banco del Austro in Ecuador, was also reported to have lost $12 million to attackers\n(http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-heist-swift-specialreport-idUSKCN0YB0DD) using\nfraudulent SWIFT transactions. However, no details are currently known about the tools used in this\nincident or if there are any links to the attacks in Asia.\nSymantec has identiﬁed three pieces of malware which were being used in limited targeted attacks\nagainst the ﬁnancial industry in South-East Asia: Backdoor.Fimlis (https://www.symantec.com\n/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-021219-3219-99), Backdoor.Fimlis.B\n(https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-021220-0239-99), and\nBackdoor.Contopee (https://www.symantec.com/security_response\n/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-021515-4543-99). At ﬁrst, it was unclear what the motivation behind these\nattacks were, however code sharing between Trojan.Banswift (https://www.symantec.com\n/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-042523-1230-99) (used in the Bangladesh attack used\nto manipulate SWIFT transactions) and early variants of Backdoor.Contopee provided a connection.\nWhile analyzing samples of Trojan.Banswift (https://www.symantec.com/security_response\n/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-042523-1230-99), a distinct ﬁle wiping code was found. Some of the\ndistinctive properties of the wiping code include:\nFunction takes two parameters: path of ﬁle to overwrite and number of iterations (max six)\nIt will initially overwrite the last byte of the target ﬁle with 0x5F\nSix “control” bytes are supplied which dictate what bytes are used during the overwriteSWIFT attackers’ malware linked to more financial attacks | Symantec ... http://web.archive.org/web/20160527050022/https://www.symantec.com...\n2 of 7 24-Mar-20, 15:52processSWIFT attackers’ malware linked to more financial attacks | Symantec ... http://web.archive.org/web/20160527050022/https://www.symantec.com...\n3 of 7 24-Mar-20, 15:52SWIFT attackers’ malware linked to more financial attacks | Symantec ... http://web.archive.org/web/20160527050022/https://www.symantec.com...\n4 of 7 24-Mar-20, 15:52Figure 1. Unique wiping code found in Trojan.Banswift and additional Lazarus tools\nAlready this code looked fairly unique. What was even more interesting was that when we searched\nfor additional malware containing the exact combination of “control” bytes, an early variant of\nBackdoor.Contopee and the “msoutc.exe”  sample already discussed in the recent BAE blog\n(http://baesystemsai.blogspot.ie/2016/05/cyber-heist-attribution.html) analyzing the Bangladesh\nattack were also found.\nSymantec believes distinctive code shared between families and the fact that Backdoor.Contopee\nwas being used in limited targeted attacks against ﬁnancial institutions in the region, means these\ntools can be attributed to the same group.\nBackdoor.Contopee has been previously used by attackers associated with a broad threat group\nknown as Lazarus. Lazarus has been linked to a string of aggressive attacks since 2009\n(http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/collaborative-operation-blockbuster-aims-send-lazarus-\nback-dead), largely focused on targets in the US and South Korea. The group was linked\nto Backdoor.Destover (http://www.symantec.com/security_response\n/writeup.jsp?docid=2014-120209-5631-99), a highly destructive Trojan that was the subject of an FBI\nwarning after it was used in an attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. The FBI concluded that\nthe North Korean government was responsible for this attack (https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel\n/press-releases/update-on-sony-investigation).\nThe group was the target of a cross-industry initiative known as Operation Blockbuster earlier this\nyear, which involved major security vendors sharing intelligence and resources in order to assist\ncommercial and government organizations in protecting themselves against Lazarus. As part of the\ninitiative, vendors are circulating malware signatures and other useful intelligence related to these\nattackers.\nThe discovery of more attacks provides further evidence that the group involved is conducting a\nwide campaign against ﬁnancial targets in the region. While awareness of the threat posed by the\ngroup has now been raised, its initial success may prompt other attack groups to launch similar\nattacks. Banks and other ﬁnancial institutions should remain vigilant.\nSymantec and Norton products protect against these threats with the following detections:\nTrojan.Banswift (https://www.symantec.com/security_responseSWIFT attackers’ malware linked to more financial attacks | Symantec ... http://web.archive.org/web/20160527050022/https://www.symantec.com...\n5 of 7 24-Mar-20, 15:52/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-042523-1230-99)\nTrojan.Banswift!gen1 (https://www.symantec.com/security_response\n/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-052019-4109-99)\nBackdoor.Contopee (https://www.symantec.com/security_response\n/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-021515-4543-99)\nBackdoor.Fimlis (https://www.symantec.com/security_response\n/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-021219-3219-99)\nBackdoor.Fimlis.B (https://www.symantec.com/security_response\n/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-021220-0239-99)\nTags: Products (/connect/search?ﬁlters=im_vid_31:691), Endpoint Protection (/connect/product/endpoint-\nprotection), Security Response (/connect/search?ﬁlters=im_vid_51:2261), Backdoor.Contopee (/connect\n/search?ﬁlters=im_vid_111:100251), Backdoor.Destover (/connect/search?ﬁlters=im_vid_111:88501), Backdoor.Fimlis\n(/connect/search?ﬁlters=im_vid_111:100261), Backdoor.Fimlis.B (/connect/search?ﬁlters=im_vid_111:100271),\nPhilippines (/connect/search?ﬁlters=im_vid_111:85001), Trojan.Banswift (/connect/search?ﬁlters=im_vid_111:100231),\nTrojan.Banswift!gen1 (/connect/search?ﬁlters=im_vid_111:100241)\nSubscriptions (0)\n(/connect/user/symantec-security-response )\nView Proﬁle  (/connect/user/symantec-security-response)\nWelcome to the Security Community on Symantec Connect.\nThe Security Community covers many diﬀerent security products\nfrom Symantec and provides valuable technical information for each.\nPlease feel free to contact me via private message with any questions you may have.\nI look forward to hearing from you and answering any questions about the Community.SWIFT attackers’ malware linked to more financial attacks | Symantec ... http://web.archive.org/web/20160527050022/https://www.symantec.com...\n6 of 7 24-Mar-20, 15:52Send a private message to the Community Manager  (/connect/messages\n/new/6603431?destination=user%2F6603431 )\n (/connect/user/riai )ℬrίαη (/connect/user/riai )\n (/connect/user/mithun-sanghavi )Mithun Sanghavi  (/connect/user/mithun-sanghavi )\n (/connect/user/vikram-kumar-sav-sep )Vikram Kumar-SAV to SEP  (/connect/user/vikram-kumar-\nsav-sep)\n (/connect/user/rafeeq )Rafeeq (/connect/user/rafeeq )\n (/connect/user/pk-1 )P_K_ (/connect/user/pk-1 )\n (/connect/user/aboonaim-golandaz )Aboonaim Golandaz  (/connect/user/aboonaim-golandaz )\n (/connect/user/craigev )CraigEV (/connect/user/craigev )\n (/connect/user/pete4u2002 )pete_4u2002  (/connect/user/pete4u2002 )\n (/connect/user/dlp-solutions2 )DLP Solutions2  (/connect/user/dlp-solutions2 )\n (/connect/user/aravind-ghosh )Aravind Ghosh  (/connect/user/aravind-ghosh )\n(https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/G7KVZWQ )\nContact Us  (/connect/contact) Privacy Policy  (http://web.archive.org/web/20160605223903/http://www.symantec.com\n/about/proﬁle/policies/privacy.jsp) Terms and Conditions  (/connect/legal) Earn Rewards  (/connect/points) Rewards\nTerms and Conditions  (/connect/blogs/symantec-connect-rewards-program-terms-and-conditions)\n© 2016 Symantec Corporation\n (http://web.archive.org/web/20160527050022/https://twitter.com/symantec)  (http://web.archive.org\n/web/20160527050022/https://www.facebook.com/Symantec)  (http://web.archive.org/web/20160527050022/https:\n//www.linkedin.com/company/symantec)SWIFT attackers’ malware linked to more financial attacks | Symantec ... http://web.archive.org/web/20160527050022/https://www.symantec.com...\n7 of 7 24-Mar-20, 15:52"
