Before anyone has time to draw a breath after the barrage,\nyet another zero-day has appeared, ready to cause people problems. Well, for people in Japan at least, since the\nvulnerability is in the Japanese word-processing software Ichitaro.\nIchitaro developer JustSystems recently announced  that the Multiple Ichitaro Products Unspecified Remote Code\nExecution Vulnerability  (CVE-2013-5990), allowing the execution of arbitrary code, exists in Ichitaro products. In\nSeptember 2013, Symantec discovered attacks in the wild attempting to exploit this vulnerability; however, the\nexploits did not properly work to compromise the system in our testing environment. As always, we exercised the\nresponsible vulnerability disclosure process following this discovery.\nOur analysis revealed that the samples, detected as Trojan.Mdropper , for these attacks all contained the same\nback door Trojan, which Symantec detected as Backdoor.Vidgrab . If the exploit is successful, in theory the shell\ncode would be executed to drop and launch the simplified Chinese version of notepad.exe while compromising the\nsystem, with the back door connecting to a remote site. Coincidently, the identical Backdoor.Vidgrab variant was\nused as a payload for a watering hole attack exploiting the Microsoft Internet Explorer Memory Corruption\nVulnerability  (CVE-2013-3893), which was patched in October 2013. It is reasonable to assume that the same\nmalware group, or another group with close connections, is behind the attacks that utilized the Internet Explorer\nand Ichitaro vulnerabilities. Backdoor.Vidgrab is known to be used to target the Asia-Pacific region with government\nsectors being the primary targets according to TrendMicro . Symantec telemetries do not dispute this claim.\nAlthough Trojan.Mdropper is sent to targets as email attachments with the Ichitaro file extension .jtd, the files are\nactually .rtf or rich text format files. The files cannot be opened using Microsoft Word as they are designed to work\nonly with Ichitaro. An interesting point of this attack campaign is that the malware group used unusual subject\nlines and email content that are not commonly used in targeted attacks. One of the emails used in this targeted\nattack campaign can be seen in the following figure.\nFigure.  Email used in targeted attack\nThe email solicits a recipient to buy various goods from a popular Japanese online shopping site. The email also\nstates that all members will earn double the usual points for their purchases and will also receive free shipping. The\nemail attachment is a flyer containing the Ichitaro exploit.\nIn June 2013, Symantec came across a similar Trojan.Mdropper variant with the .jtd file extension, sent to an\norganization that received the malware mentioned above. The main difference is the file format. While rich text\nformat was used in the recent attacks, a Microsoft Word document file with an embedded Microsoft graph chart\nwas used for the previous attack campaign. The specially-crafted Word document was created with Microsoft\nOffice in the Simplified Chinese language. According to our research, this exploit code also failed to successfully\nexploit a vulnerability. If successful, the shellcode would have downloaded malware from the following URL :\nhttp://googles.al[REMOVED]my.com/index.html\nThe server hosting this domain has been associated with the group referred to as APT 12 by Mandiant. The\nmalware itself is detected as Trojan.Krast .\nThe attackers, possibly belonging to the APT12 group who may have also developed BackdoorVidgrab, are\npersistently targeting similar, if not the identical, targets by attempting to exploit Ichitaro. The attackers may also\nbe using the targets as guinea pigs to test if the exploit code works properly. The attack may also be a precursor,\nthe attackers could have run the tests in order to find effective email contents and subject lines, for example, that\nare enticing enough lure targets into opening the malicious attachment.\nThe .jtd files described in this blog are detected as Trojan.Mdropper. Also Symantec’s .Cloud products effectively\nblock emails with the malicious Ichitaro attachment.\nTo prevent a possible compromise, Ichitaro users are advised to download and apply the latest patch from\nJustSystems.\nBlog Entry Filed Under:\nSecurity , Security Response , Endpoint Protection (AntiVirus) , Backdoor.Vidgrab , Ichitaro , Japan , Trojan.Krast , Trojan.Mdropper ,\nzero-day\nShare\nLinksLinks\nTechnical SupportTechnical Support\nSymantec TrainingSymantec Training\nSymantec.comSymantec.com\nPurchase Endpoint Protection SmallPurchase Endpoint Protection Small\nBusiness EditionBusiness Edition\nPurchase SSL CertificatesPurchase SSL Certificates\nAbout Security ResponseAbout Security Response\nBlogBlog\nOur security research centers\naround the world provide\nunparalleled analysis of and\nprotection from malware, security\nrisks, vulnerabilities, and spam.\nRecent Blog PostsRecent Blog Posts\nSnapchat Fruit Spam Delivered by Real,\nCompromised Accounts • Satnam Narang  • 12\nFeb 2014 18:59:14 GMT\nMicrosoft Patch Tuesday – February 2014  •\nDinesh Theerthagiri  • 11 Feb 2014 19:49:38\nGMT\nMy (Failed) Visits to Spammers’ Offices  • Eric\nPark  • 11 Feb 2014 17:55:34 GMT\nThe Mask  • Stephen Doherty  • 12 Feb 2014\n01:22:41 GMT\nTiylon: A Modern Bank Robber  • Christian\nTripputi  • 07 Feb 2014 13:13:29 GMT\nFilter by:Filter by:\nAuthor\nEnglish\nBlog TagsBlog Tags\nSecurity Response BlogSecurity Response Blog\nArchiveArchive\nFebruary 2014  (12)\nJanuary 2014  (17)\nDecember 2013  (16)\nNovember 2013  (24)\nOctober 2013  (20)\nSeptember 2013  (14)\nAugust 2013  (16)\nJuly 2013  (34)\nJune 2013  (32)\nMay 2013  (27)\nApril 2013  (23)\nMarch 2013  (23)\nFebruary 2013  (26)\nJanuary 2013  (22)\nDecember 2012  (17)\nNovember 2012  (19)\nOctober 2012  (14)\nSeptember 2012  (15)\nAugust 2012  (29)\nJuly 2012  (26)\nJune 2012  (22)\nMay 2012  (26)\nApril 2012  (16)\nMarch 2012  (23)\nFebruary 2012  (18)\nJanuary 2012  (17)\nDecember 2011  (12)\nNovember 2011  (11)\nOctober 2011  (20)\nSeptember 2011  (13)\nAugust 2011  (20)\nJuly 2011  (19)\nJune 2011  (29)\nMay 2011  (26)\nApril 2011  (18)\nMarch 2011  (31)\nFebruary 2011  (23)\nJanuary 2011  (19)\nDecember 2010  (11)\nNovember 2010  (17)\nOctober 2010  (24)\nSeptember 2010  (30)\nAugust 2010  (26)\nJuly 2010  (32)\nJune 2010  (26)\nMay 2010  (26)\nApril 2010  (32)\nMarch 2010  (31)\nFebruary 2010  (30)\nJanuary 2010  (26)\nDecember 2009  (21)\nNovember 2009  (32)\nOctober 2009  (38)\nSeptember 2009  (21)\nAugust 2009  (31)\nJuly 2009  (36)\nJune 2009  (24)\nMay 2009  (23)\nApril 2009  (35)\nMarch 2009  (43)\nFebruary 2009  (25)\nJanuary 2009  (29)\nDecember 2008  (17)\nNovember 2008  (21)\nOctober 2008  (22)\nSeptember 2008  (17)\nAugust 2008  (22)\nJuly 2008  (8)\nJune 2008  (8)\nMay 2008  (9)\nApril 2008  (18)\nMarch 2008  (20)\nFebruary 2008  (30)\nJanuary 2008  (29)\nDecember 2007  (34)\nNovember 2007  (42)\nOctober 2007  (45)\nSeptember 2007  (31)\nAugust 2007  (41)\nJuly 2007  (35)\nJune 2007  (34)\nMay 2007  (38)\nApril 2007  (41)\nMarch 2007  (55)\nFebruary 2007  (45)\nJanuary 2007  (43)\nDecember 2006  (43)\nNovember 2006  (40)\nOctober 2006  (30)\nSeptember 2006  (26)\nAugust 2006  (31)\nJuly 2006  (33)\nJune 2006  (14)\nMay 2006  (19)\nApril 2006  (1)Recently on TwitterRecently on Twitter\nNIST releases guide to bolster US critical\ninfrastructure cybersecurity\nhttp://t.co/sclTz5CNaE #CyberSecurity\n#CriticalInfrastructure\n13 Feb 2014\n4 out of 5 IT professionals pressured to roll\nout IT projects despite security worries\nhttp://t.co/5dAh3WCuLI #InfoSec #Security\n13 Feb 2014\n#Snapchat Fruit #Spam Delivered by Real,\nCompromised Accounts\nhttp://t.co/NN2z7fuQHt http://t.co/cTDwuLt0JO\n12 Feb 2014\nBitcoin exchanges suffer denial of service\nattacks http://t.co/kZKNLfebKN\n#DenialOfService #Bitcoin\n12 Feb 2014\nYou can find Symantec's blog post on\nMSFT's February #PatchTuesday updates\nhere: http://t.co/dXQhcqXzIw\n11 Feb 2014\nEndpoint Protection\n(AntiVirus)  Spam  Online Fraud\nMalicious Code  phishing\nMessaging Gateway  Message\nFilter  Symantec Protection\nSuites (SPS)  Mail Security for\nExchange/Domino\nVulnerabilities & Exploits  Email\nSecurity.cloud  Email Encryption\nEndpoint Encryption  Security\nRisks  Emerging Threats  Android\nEvolution of Security  Microsoft Patch\nTuesday  Mobile & Wireless  W32.Stuxnet\nfacebook  Trojan.Zbot  IT Risk Management\nscam  Internet Security Threat Report\nBlogsBlogs\n COMMUNITY:COMMUNITY: SecuritySecurity\n "
