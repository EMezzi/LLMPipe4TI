All Rights Reserved.TECHNOLOGY NEWS MAY 20, 2016 / 7:25 AM / 4 YEARS AGO\nSpecial Report: Cyber thieves exploit banks'\nfaith in SWIFT transfer network\nTom Bergin , Nathan Layne 11 MIN READ\nLONDON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Shortly after 7 p.m. on January 12, 2015, a message\nfrom a secure computer terminal at Banco del Austro (BDA) in Ecuador instructed San\nFrancisco-based Wells Fargo to transfer money to bank accounts in Hong Kong.\nWells Fargo complied. Over 10 days, Wells approved a total of at least 12 transfers of\nBDA funds requested over the secure SWIFT system.\nThe SWIFT network - which allows banks to process billions of dollars in transfers\neach day - is considered the backbone of international banking. In all, Wells Fargo\ntransferred $12 million of BDA’s money to accounts across the globe.\nBoth banks now believe those funds were stolen by unidentified hackers, according to\ndocuments in a BDA lawsuit filed against Wells Fargo in New York this year.\nBDA declined comment. Wells Fargo, which also initially declined comment on the\nlawsuit, said in a statement to Reuters on Friday that it “properly processed the wire\ninstructions received via authenticated SWIFT messages” and was not responsible for\nBDA’s losses.\nBDA is suing Wells Fargo on the basis that the U.S. bank should have flagged the\ntransactions as suspicious.\nWells Fargo has countered that security lapses in BDA’s own operations caused the\nEcuadorean bank’s losses. Hackers had secured a BDA employee’s SWIFT logon\ncredentials, Wells Fargo said in a February court filing.\nSWIFT, an acronym for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial\nTelecommunication, is not a party to the lawsuit.\nNeither bank reported the theft to SWIFT, which said it first learned about the cyber\nattack from a Reuters inquiry.\n“We were not aware,” SWIFT said in a statement responding to Reuters inquiries. “We\nneed to be informed by customers of such frauds if they relate to our products and\nservices, so that we can inform and support the wider community. We have been in\ntouch with the bank concerned to get more information, and are reminding customers\nof their obligations to share such information with us.”\nSWIFT says it requires customer to notify SWIFT of problems that can affect the\n“confidentiality, integrity, or availability of SWIFT service.”\nSWIFT, however, has no rule specifically requiring client banks to report hacking\nthefts. Banks often do not report such attacks out of concern they make the institution\nappear vulnerable, former SWIFT employees and cyber security experts told Reuters.\nThe Ecuador case illuminates a central problem with preventing such fraudulent\ntransfers: Neither SWIFT nor its client banks have a full picture of the frequency or the\ndetails of cyber thefts made through the network, according to more than dozen\nformer SWIFT executives, users and cyber security experts interviewed by Reuters.\nThe case - details of which have not been previously reported - raises new questions\nabout the oversight of the SWIFT network and its communications with member banks\nabout cyber thefts and risks. The network has faced intense scrutiny since cyber thieves\nstole $81 million in February from a Bangladesh central bank account at the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York.\nIt’s unclear what SWIFT tells its member banks when it does find out about cyber\nthefts, which are typically first discovered by the bank that has been defrauded. SWIFT\nspokeswoman Natasha de Terán said that the organization “was transparent with its\nusers” but declined to elaborate. SWIFT declined to answer specific questions about its\npolicies for disclosing breaches.\nOn Friday, following the publication of this Reuters story, SWIFT urged all of its users\nto notify the network of cyber attacks.\n“It is essential that you share critical security information related to SWIFT with us,”\nSWIFT said in a communication to users.\nReuters was unable to determine the number or frequency of cyber attacks involving\nthe SWIFT system, or how often the banks report them to SWIFT officials.\nThe lack of disclosure may foster overconfidence in SWIFT network security by banks,\nwhich routinely approve transfer requests made through the messaging network\nwithout additional verification, former SWIFT employees and cyber security experts\nsaid.\nThe criminals behind such heists are exploiting banks’ willingness to approve SWIFT\nrequests at face value, rather than making additional manual or automated checks,\nsaid John Doyle, who held a variety of senior roles at SWIFT between 1980 and 2005.\n“SWIFT doesn’t replace prudent banking practice” he said, noting that banks should\nverify the authenticity of withdrawal or transfer requests, as they would for money\ntransfers outside the SWIFT system.\nSWIFT commits to checking the codes on messages sent into its system, to ensure the\nmessage has originated from a client’s terminal, and to send it to the intended\nrecipient quickly and securely, former SWIFT executives and cyber security experts\nsaid. But once cyber-thieves obtain legitimate codes and credentials, they said, SWIFT\nhas no way of knowing they are not the true account holders.\nThe Bank for International Settlements, a trade body for central banks, said in a\nNovember report that increased information sharing on cyber attacks is crucial to\nhelping financial institutions manage the risk.\n“The more they share the better,” said Leo Taddeo, chief security officer at Cryptzone\nand a former special agent in charge with the FBI’s cyber crime division in New York.\nSYSTEMIC RISK\nSWIFT, a cooperative owned and governed by representatives of the banks it serves,\nwas founded in 1973 and operates a secure messaging network that has been\nconsidered reliable for four decades. But recent attacks involving the Belgium-based\ncooperative have underscored how the network’s central role in global finance also\npresents systemic risk.\nSWIFT is not regulated, but a group of ten central banks from developed nations, led\nby the National Bank of Belgium, oversee the organization. Among its stated guidelines\nis a requirement to provide clients with enough information to enable them “to\nmanage adequately the risks related to their use of SWIFT.”\nHowever, some former SWIFT employees said that the cooperative struggles to keep\nbanks informed on risks of cyber fraud because of a lack of cooperation from the banks\nthemselves. SWIFT’s 25-member board of directors is filled with representatives of\nlarger banks.\n“The banks are not going to tell us too much,” said Doyle, the former SWIFT\nexecutive. “They wouldn’t like to destabilize confidence in their institution.”\nBanks also fear notifying SWIFT or law enforcement of security breaches because that\ncould lead to regulatory investigations that highlight failures of risk management or\ncompliance that could embarrass top managers, said Hugh Cumberland, a former\nSWIFT marketing executive who is now a senior associate with cyber security firm\nPost-Quantum.\nCases of unauthorized money transfers rarely become public, in part because\ndisagreements are usually settled bilaterally or through arbitration, which is typically\nprivate, said Salvatore Scanio, a lawyer at Washington, D.C.-based Ludwig & Robinson.\nScanio said he consulted on a dispute involving millions of dollars of stolen funds and\nthe sending of fraudulent SWIFT messages similar to the BDA attack. He declined to\nname the parties or provide other details.\nTheoretically, SWIFT could require its customers, mainly banks, to inform it of any\nattacks - given that no bank could risk the threat of exclusion from the network, said\nLieven Lambrecht, the head of human resources at SWIFT for a year-and-a-half\nthrough May 2015.\nBut such a rule would require the agreement of its board, which is mainly made up of\nsenior executives from the back office divisions of the largest western banks, who\nwould be unlikely to approve such a policy, Lambrecht said.\nFIGHT OVER LIABILITY\nThis week, Vietnam’s Tien Phong Bank said its SWIFT account, too, was used in an\nattempted hack last year. That effort failed, but it is another sign that cyber-criminals\nare increasingly targeting the messaging network.\nIn the Ecuadorean case, Wells Fargo denies any liability for the fraudulent transfers\nfrom BDA accounts. Wells Fargo said in court records that it did not verify the\nauthenticity of the BDA transfer requests because they came through SWIFT, which\nWells called “among the most widely used and secure” systems for money transfers.\nBDA is seeking recovery of the money, plus interest. Wells Fargo is attempting to have\nthe case thrown out.\nNew York-based Citibank also transferred $1.8 million in response to fraudulent\nrequests made through BDA’s SWIFT terminal, according to the BDA lawsuit against\nWells Fargo.\nCitibank repaid the $1.8 million to BDA, according to a BDA court filing in April.\nCitibank declined to comment.\nFor its part, Wells Fargo refunded to BDA $958,700 out of the $1,486,230 it\ntransferred to an account in the name of a Jose Mariano Castillo at Wells Fargo in Los\nAngeles, according to the lawsuit. Reuters could not locate Castillo or verify his\nexistence.\nANATOMY OF A CYBER HEIST\nThe BDA-Wells Fargo case is unusual in that one bank took its correspondent bank to\ncourt, thus making the details public, said Scanio, the Washington attorney.\nBDA acknowledged in a January court filing that it took more than a week after the first\nfraudulent transfer request for BDA to discover the missing money.\nAfter obtaining a BDA employee’s SWIFT logon, the thieves then fished out previously\ncanceled or rejected payment requests that remained in BDA’s SWIFT outbox.\nThey then altered the amounts and destinations on the transfer requests and reissued\nthem, both banks said in filings.\nWhile Wells Fargo has claimed in court filings that failures of security at BDA are to\nblame for the breach, BDA has alleged that Wells could easily have spotted and rejected\nthe unusual transfers. BDA noted that the payment requests were made outside of its\nnormal business hours and involved unusually large amounts.\nThe BDA theft and others underscore the need for banks on both sides of such\ntransactions – often for massive sums – to rely less on SWIFT for security and\nstrengthen their own verification protocols, Cumberland said.\n“This image of the SWIFT network and the surrounding ecosystem being secure and\nimpenetrable has encouraged complacency,” he said.\nAdditional reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston and Alexandra Valencia in Quito; Editing by David Greising and Brian\nThevenot\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nMORE FROM REUTERS\nMeet the Americans still going out and gathering in large\ngroups\n19 Mar\nSwiss hospitals face collapse in 10 days if virus keeps\nspreading\n17 Mar\nRattled world 'at war' with\ncoronavirus as deaths surge in Italy...\n19 Mar\nExclusive: UK supermarkets expect\npolice support if London in...\n19 Mar\nCoronavirus can persist in air for hours\nand on surfaces for days -...\n18 Mar\nThe SWIFT logo is pictured in this photo illustration taken April 26, 2016.
