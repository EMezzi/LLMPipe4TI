Our research team monitors,\nanalyzes and validates threat actors’ malicious activities on platforms such as social\nnetworks, mobile applications, Deep Web sites, Dark Web marketplaces, hacker forums,\nIRC channels, global CVEs and external threat intelligence generated by leading\nsecurity providers. The Research team regularly produces threat alerts and intelligence\nreports based on region, industry and organization-specific threats, including in-depth\nanalysis, actionable recommendations, IoCs and more, to proactively identify and\nmitigate threats before they materialize, to enhance resilience and prevent future attacks\nThe CVE-2018-8174 vulnerability in Internet Explorer was found using OSINT tools and used by a nation-state\ngroup from North Korea. By constantly monitoring news outlets with WEBINT platforms, we discovered that the\nvulnerability was later adopted by cyber criminals globally, and was embedded inside exploit kits that were\ntraded throughout dark-web platforms. The following is an in-depth exploration of our findings surrounding the\nvulnerability.\nThe CVE-2018-8174 vulnerability, also dubbed “Double Kill,” was discovered  in the beginning of May 2018,\nwhen it was exploited as a 0-day in an APT attack leveraging malicious Office files in China. The vulnerability\naffects users with Internet Explorer installed , either after they browse the web or after they open crafted Office\ndocuments – even if the default browser on the victim’s machine is not set to IE. Moreover, it also\naffects IE11 , even though VBScript is no longer supported by using the compatibility tag for IE10.\nMicrosoft patched  the vulnerability on May 8, 2018.\nWe use WEBINT tools frequently to monitor underground hacking communities, in this case, our monitoring\nrevealed that since its discovery, various threat actors in the Russian underground hacking scene have shown\na keen interest in this particular vulnerability, indicating their strong intent to exploit it in attacks. Since then, we\nhave observed exploits for this vulnerability incorporated into several prominent attack tools used by\nRussian threat actors, including the RIG Exploit Kit  and the Threadkit  package of Office exploits\nindicating that cybercriminals see it as a profitable attack vector . Concurrently, security reports state that\nthe exploitation of this vulnerability has been witnessed in additional attack campaigns.\nTHE CVE-2018-8174 EXPLOIT\nThe vulnerability exists in the VBScript – incorporated both in the Internet Explorer browser and in Microsoft\nOffice software. Being a use-after-free (UAF) memory vulnerability, it is particularly dangerous because of the\nenabling of the execution of arbitrary code, or, in some cases, full remote code execution, due to access to read\nand write primitives.\nThe APT attack spotted in China, later attributed to North Korean  threat actors, used the URL Moniker\ntechnique to load the VisualBasic exploit leveraging CVE-2017-8174 into the Office process. Unlike previously-\nknown Office exploits that used the same technique, the URL link in the current exploit calls the mshtml.dll ,\nwhich is a library that contains the Visual Basic engine in Internet Explorer. Thus, albeit delivered via a Word\ndocument as the initial attack vector, the exploit takes advantage of a vulnerability in VBScript, and\nnot in Microsoft Word.\nThis attack vector allows the attackers to incorporate Internet Explorer Browser exploits directly into\nOffice documents, enabling them to use it via spear-phishing and drive-by campaigns.  Immediately\nupon its discovery, it was estimated that the vulnerability would be exploited in multiple attack campaigns in the\nnear future.\nThe in-the wild exploit consisted of three stages:\n Figure 1: Microsoft Office alert pops-up when opening the crafted document\nDownload the eBook: Top 10 CTI Use Cases\nUNDERGROUND CHATTER REGARDING THE EXPLOIT\n. At the same time, we have spotted vigorous chatter regarding this vulnerability emerging on underground\nsources, in particular in Russian-speaking forums. Threat actors sought to purchase the exploit, and others\nshared PoC samples for the explicit purpose of their analysis and further modification.\nFigure 2:  CVE-2018-8174 exploit is mentioned on underground chatter.

Of\nnote, operators of malware targeting both Microsoft Office and IE browser announced the addition of the exploit\nto their attack tools, indicating that the malicious payload is to be delivered by one of these two vulnerable\nsoftware types. As explained above,\nWe detected an exploit for CVE-2018-8174 added to the following attack tools traded on the Russian\nunderground:\nRead the ebook on the top 10 Cyber Threat Intelligence use cases that provide the visibility and proximity\nrequired for building a successful, proactive cyber threat intelligence operation.\nFigure 3: The RIG campaign’s infection chain.
