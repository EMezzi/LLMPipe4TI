If successful, the attack plants\nmalware onto machines that is capable of extracting the user's files, email,\npasswords and other sensitive personal information.\nThe attack, which ran between 7 and 9 May, was detected by web security\nfirm Websense, which informed Amnesty about the threat. The human rights\norganisation has since cleaned up its site.\nAmnesty International is no stranger to this type of attack. Its UK site was hit\nby a similar drive-by-download-style attack back in 2009, and a similar\nassault  was launched against its Hong Kong site a year later.\nWebsense has a write-up of the latest assault in a blog post here.\nThe Gh0st Trojan has been used by suspected Chinese hackers in several\nadvanced persistent threat (APT) style attacks, most notably the ‘Nitro’\nattacks against energy firms in 2011. Chinese involvement in the Amnesty\nInternational attack is suspected but unproven.\n\"Yesterday [Wednesday] Amnesty.org.uk was infected with a piece of\nmalicious code. As soon as we became aware of the infection we worked\nwith our hosting company to isolate it and remove it as a matter of urgency.\nThe problem was resolved by yesterday lunchtime,\" the organization told El\nReg in a statement.\n\"Security is very important to us and as well as extensive security measure\nin place to prevent exploits such as this, we also have constant monitoring\nin place to alert us immediately when incidents like this occur. 'All our users\nprofiles are held on a completely separate website and server and were in\nno way compromised by this incident.\" ®\nSponsored: Practical tips for Office 365 tenant-to-tenant migration\nMORE  Websense  Human Rights  Drive-By Download\n   {* *}\nBy John Leyden  11 May 2012 at 16:28\nTips and corrections 5 Comments\nSign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily-MOST READ\n1  \n2  \n3  \n4  \n5  \nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR WEEKLY\nTECH NEWSLETTER//\nNASA to launch 247\npetabytes of data into AWS\n– but forgot about eye-\nwatering cloudy egress\ncosts before lift-off\nBritish Army adopts\nWhatsApp for formal orders\nas coronavirus isolation\nkicks in\nClosed source?
